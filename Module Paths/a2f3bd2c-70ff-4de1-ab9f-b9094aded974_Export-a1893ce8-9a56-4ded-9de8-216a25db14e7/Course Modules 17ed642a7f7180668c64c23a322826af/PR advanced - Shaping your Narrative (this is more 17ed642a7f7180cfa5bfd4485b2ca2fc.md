Good - maybe some more tools

Managing your reputation on social media isn’t a one-size-fits-all process. TikTok, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, and other platforms each have their own audiences, cultures, and quirks. 

On Linkedin talking about meetings that could have been emails might get you clout

But on Tiktok, you will look like a nerd.

Mastering online PR means tailoring your content tactics to each network—here’s how:

Fundamentally, regardless of platform, authenticity in your message is king, and must be stuck to at all times. How you communicate this, however, changes:

Tiktok is the current “platform of the people”, with anonymised users, and billions of people on the app, Tiktok, like X can be love or hate based on how you handle PR.

Like walking into a formal party dressed in a suit, you want to make sure your video style is appropriate for the platform your on.

Tiktok demands authenticity. We create high production value videos, but what our clients talk about is deep rooted knowledge and expertise. Never stray from what you know, and stay consistent.

With Tiktok, if you don’t engage with your audience authentically, people will sniff it out. Remember, you either shape the conversation, or the conversation shapes you.

Jump into the comments, use genuine interest with the positive ones and humour with the negatives. But always retain control of the narrative through responses.

Instagram is a little more polite. 

People’s names and faces are easily visible, and their mum probably follows them.

Therefore, Instagram is less likely to be vitriolic. 

Instagram is more polished, it is a faux pas to have an ugly feed, focus on aesthetics.

Like jumping into the comments on Tiktok, stories are the equivalent way to generate goodwill in your community. Keep it on brand but lowkey - a bts to your grid’s front of house, and you will build trust.

Linkedin is the final boss of politeness. And its filled with bots.

Expect positive comments as you grow, but take them all with a pinch of salt. People’s careers are on the line. Match the tone, comment on others’ posts and don’t be red pilling people about how fake Linkedin is.

Linkedin does have a strong preference toward business/self help content so lead with the videos that talk most about that.

Fundamentally remember, whatever platform your on, our method is designed for humans, not algorithms. So a video that follows the rules will do well wherever it’s posted.

So, to the opposite end of the spectrum, Linkedin.

On Linkedin perceived expertise take center stage. Credibility is fragile here—any exaggerations or controversies are taken seriously. Long-form content opportunities, such as articles and newsletters, can deepen your thought leadership. Building trust might involve publishing data-backed opinion pieces, cultivating endorsements from well-respected colleagues, or hosting live Q&A sessions to maintain open dialogue with a professional audience.

Instagram, meanwhile, is all about a polished, visual identity. While a cohesive aesthetic can enhance credibility, poorly executed Q&As or inconsistent content can damage trust. Reels and Story highlights can fan the flames of a crisis just as easily as they can defuse it, so it’s wise to keep your brand voice consistent across fleeting Stories and your permanent feed.

 Occasionally showing raw, behind-the-scenes moments might humanize you, but you can still tie everything together with a cohesive look on the main grid. Using interactive features like polls can help you gauge sentiment before issues escalate, while dedicated highlight reels can offer ongoing transparency about any clarifications or FAQs related to your brand.

YouTube’s long-form format presents its own set of vulnerabilities. A misunderstood statement in a 30-minute video can linger and be analyzed in great detail by viewers or even rival creators. Comment sections often function as echo chambers that heavily influence perception, so preemptively establishing community guidelines is one way to set expectations for civil discourse and content standards. Transparency can also be woven into your videos by dedicating chapters at the start to address potential controversies or disclaimers. In the event of serious issues, response videos or live AMA sessions can allow you to tackle misunderstandings head-on, showing authenticity in a way that helps stop negative narratives from gaining further ground.

If a crisis or misunderstanding is spreading across multiple platforms at once, it’s essential to coordinate your messaging. Inconsistent statements only breed more distrust, so determine which platform is experiencing the highest level of fallout and start there, then adapt your response for other networks. Each platform excels at different forms of communication—TikTok can deliver quick clarity, LinkedIn is suited for formal statements or data-focused explanations, Instagram thrives on visual story flow, and YouTube allows extended commentary or Q&A streams where you can dive deeper into context.

Building an engaged, proactive community is another key layer of protection. Some creators develop ambassador programs where their most loyal followers become advocates in comment sections. Offering exclusive content, early access to new releases, or in-person events can help keep these ambassadors invested in your success. Private Discord servers or subscription-only feeds like Patreon can also act as safe spaces to address core fans directly, testing out statements or clarifications before going fully public.
