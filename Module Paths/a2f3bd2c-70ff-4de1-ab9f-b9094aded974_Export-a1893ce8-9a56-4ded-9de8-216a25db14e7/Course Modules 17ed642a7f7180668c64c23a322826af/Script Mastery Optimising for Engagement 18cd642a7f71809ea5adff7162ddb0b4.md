    So you’ve got your hook, you’ve got your idea. Now, how do you actually turn that into a compelling video? How do you structure what you say in a way that keeps people watching? That all comes down to your script.
    
    But here’s the thing—short-form scripting isn’t like traditional scriptwriting or copywriting. If you try to write your video like a linkedin post an article or a speech, it’s going to flop. Hard.
    
    Short-form has its own set of rules—seven, to be exact. Let’s break them down.
    
    (and if you get all the way through to the end, i’ll give you a bonus hacky one)
    
    ### 1. The first rule of short-form scripting is simplicity.
    
    Just like we discussed in the cardinal rules section, your video should make sense to *anyone* who comes across it, even if they’re half-asleep at 3 a.m. or just casually scrolling. So you should assume your viewer has zero prior knowledge, and is incapable of grasping difficult concepts. Use everyday language, avoid big words, and get your point across in the clearest way possible. Basically, remove any pretentiousness or intellectual points, keep it simple.
    
    A great way to check this is to read your script out loud. If you stumble over a sentence, or if it sounds too formal, rewrite it conversationally. The more it feels like you’re talking naturally, the better.
    
    ### 2. The second rule of short-form scripting is to be concise.
    
    Attention spans are getting worse across the population, and they’re even worse on short-form platforms. If people zone out of your video for even a moment, they’ll scroll away. So cut any fluff from your script. Reword sentences to be shorter. If you find yourself repeating the same point, trim it out.
    
    As a general rule, if the first draft of your script is 500 words, only 250 are necessary. Cut half of it out. Don’t waste anyone’s time. If you can say something in fewer words, do it.
    
    ### 3. The third rule of short-form scripting is rehook, rehook, rehook.
    
    Again, you have to assume your viewer doesn’t want to watch your video. Keeping them engaged is a constant battle, and you need to use your script to make them feel like they *have* to keep watching. The way to do this is through layered hooking—using multiple curiosity loops inside the same video.
    
    We’ve already established that the hook creates a question in the viewer’s mind, opening up a curiosity loop that needs to be closed. But the second that loop is closed, and that question is answered, the viewer is gone. So you need to rehook them. Again and again.
    
    Think of it like a chain: hook → deliver → rehook immediately → deliver → rehook → deliver → rehook, and so on.
    
    Now, the key to layering hooks effectively is to make sure they don’t feel disconnected or random. Each curiosity loop should build on the previous one, leading the viewer deeper into the video.
    
    A great way to do this is through advanced bridging. Rather than just stacking hooks randomly, use transitions that pull the viewer along. Lines like “But wait, to understand that, you need to know this first…” or “And here’s where it gets even crazier…” keep them engaged without feeling like they’re being strung along.
    
    Another crucial part of this process is delivering on your hooks. You can’t just keep opening loops and never closing them, otherwise people will get frustrated and leave. You need to find a balance—keep the viewer guessing, but give them enough answers along the way to feel satisfied.
    
    ### 4. The fourth rule of short-form scripting is authenticity.
    
    Again, we don’t want to slip into ‘salesy’ territory, and if your script sounds too much like copy, viewers feel like they’re watching an ad and leave. Now a lot of you will be selling somethingSo here’s how to make sure your script feels natural.
    
    The best way to approach this is to imagine you’re at a dinner party, trying to explain your point to a group of people you don’t know that well, without boring anyone. If you can write your script in that way, it’s going to feel much more authentic and engaging.
    
    Now, if you can sit down and write that naturally right away, great. But if that’s difficult, there’s a really simple way to fix it. Write your script in your normal copy-like style, then take a break from it. After a while, pick up your phone and, without reading from your script, try to explain the idea out loud as if you were talking to a friend in a voice message. Then transcribe what you said, clean it up a bit, and you’ll have a much more natural-sounding script.
    
    ### 5. The fifth rule of short-form scripting is storytelling.
    
    At the end of the day, a short-form script is storytelling. It may be short and simple storytelling, but it’s still storytelling. And just like any good story, your video needs tension, conflict, and resolution.
    
    One of the core principles of storytelling is conflict. Every story has a good and an evil force, fighting it out, and ultimately one of them will win. That conflict can be big or small—it could be a bad opinion someone has, a funny mishap, a challenge you had to overcome—but there has to be some form of tension that keeps the audience watching.
    
    Another key principle of storytelling is emotional resonance. People need to feel something when they watch your video. That could be anger, catharsis, joy, outrage, shock, sadness, or guilt—honestly, it doesn’t really matter what the emotion is, as long as it’s there. The worst reaction your video can get is indifference. So when you read your script back, ask yourself, what emotion is this making people feel? If there’s no clear answer, rewrite it.
    
    ### 6. The sixth rule of short-form scripting is: would I watch this?
    
    So you’ve followed all these rules, and you’ve written out a script. But it’s very easy to sit and read it through and think, “It’s okay, I wouldn’t watch it, but I guess I’m not the target audience.”
    
    This is a dangerous way to think. With organic growth, *everyone* is your target audience. The way social media works, people end up watching content on topics they don’t even care about, just because it’s engaging. And that’s the goal—you don’t just want your content to be interesting to people already in your niche, you want it to be engaging enough to *anyone* who comes across it.
    
    So if you’re reading through your script and realizing that even *you* wouldn’t watch it, then it’s almost guaranteed to flop. If you get bored, so will everyone else.
    

This section will focus on how to master scripting, or more specifically, how to optimise your scripts for maximum engagement - and conversion. 

In the last scripting section we talked about the six rules of short form: simplicity, conciseness, rehooking, authenticity, storytelling and ‘would I watch this’.

All of this still applies. Although you can add in these optimisations to really take it a step further, don’t add them at the expense of any of those six rules. Those are still the MOST important thing about your script. 

That being said. Here are five ways you can make it better (with a bonus section if you stay all the way to the end). 

### **Optimising scripts for comments**

So we’ve already covered metrics, where I spoke in depth about the importance of comments. If you don’t remember, the short of it is, the more comments on your video the longer people watch it, and the better is does in the algorithm. I have yet to see a viral video with a bad comment section, and a good comment section don’t just come about randomly. There’s always a reason it’s there, and you can engineer it yourself in your script. 

There are four types of comment section I’ve noticed cropping up. 

1. OMG I can’t believe you did that. 

The first type of comment section I see, is full of people pointing out a mistake you made, pointing out something weird you did, or just straight up pointing out how WRONG you are. 

Things like, cooking a recipe and putting a stock cube in with the wrapper still on. Or leaving all the taps running in the background of your video. Or pronouncing someones name incredibly wrong. It can literally be anything, however small, and a surprising amount of people will go out of their way to comment and tell you about it. They assume you did this thing intentionally, and they want to seem smart for noticing and correcting you. They want the credit for being clever. 

Of course, what most viewers don’t realise is that 99% of the time this happens, the creator is doing it to get more views. It is on purpose, because they get a load of comments. Maybe you didn’t know this either until now - in which case, sorry you’ve been played, but welcome to the club. Social media REALLY is all an illusion. 

Now this type of comment is pretty easy to engineer in the script. You can put in the wrong word, say a wrong fact (but if you do this one make sure for that it’s a fact that EVERYONE knows) or even just pronounce a word wrong. 

Another good thing to do, although we’re slipping even further into rage bait territory here, is to state something as fact, that is actually really an opinion. Like ‘so as we know, all Swifties are millenials, but what I really want to talk about is…’ 

If you say something like this as fact, and then move on. Trust me - you will get views. 

Now this being said, and a disclaimer for all the rest of the hacks, is you don’t want to do this TOO much, or you might come across as stupid. The aim is obviously to get more views, but not at the expense of your image. So do his sparingly. But at the end of each script, just have at think about something you could get a little wrong. A word you could pronounce a little different, that will get you a viral video. 

1. FOMO

In this type of comment section, everyone is talking about the same thing, that you don’t understand yet because it’s right at the end of the video. 

‘OMG that joke about the leopards was so funny’ ‘hahah I didn’t know that about leopards’ ‘I SPOTTED that joke at the end lol’. People are connecting and laughing about something in the comments, that the majority of viewers haven’t seen yet. 

When I’m watching a video, even if i like it, I am kind of bored. So I’ll head to the comments to have some extra level of stimulation to keep me going. And in this type of comment section, I’ll get there and realise everyone is talking about the same thing. It feels like they’re all in on a joke that I’m not part of - because I haven’t got to that part of the video yet - and so I stay. I basically, get FOMO from people bonding in the comments, and even if the video is boring and I was ready to scroll away - I will stay to the end so that I get to be part of the joke. The viewers are literally writing a rehook for you and it carries the video. 

So the way to optimise for this, is to put your unique talking about, your controversial thing, or your joke or your mistake, whatever it is, in the last 10 seconds. Make that the main talking point, and your commenters will create the PERFECT reason for new people to keep watching. Noone likes feeling left out. 

1. Controversy

The third type of comment section is people arguing. This is the most common type of comment section, and they do incredibly well for a few reasons. The first is that can get lost in one of these comment sections for HOURS (which by proxy means people watch your video for HOURS). In a good heated section there will be replies, on replies, on replies, for thousands of comments. Each adding something new, and creating more drama for the viewer to be part of. 

This type of comment section is also great, as when people get a response to their comment, they get a notification. Bringing them back to the app (which the app loves) and bringing them back to your video (meaning they watch and interact with it). So the debaters will just keep pushing your video further and further into the algorithm, even if you posted it weeks ago. 

Another reason it does well, - honestly there’s a reason you should optimise for this one -  is that by being SO divisive, it gets into multiple algorithms. normally a video will only really hit one type of person: people who are interested in that topic. but a controversy video will hit the hater, the supporters, the people who hate the haters, the people who hate the supporters, the people who support the haters and the people who support the supporters. Plus any neutral people who just love the drama. This compounds and SKYROCKETS your video. 

This ones pretty simple to optimise for, all you need to do is bring out a controversial topic, something that’s hot at the moment, and lean *slightly* to one side of it. Don’t lean too much, definitely not into preachy territory, just stoke the fire with a quick quip or assumption- and let people do the talking. 

For this, if you REALLY want it to go viral, say something controversial that impacts a fandom (for example, film bros and incels are SO EASY to catch out it’s ridiculous. 

1. Hey - my time to talk!

The fourth type of comment section is people adding to the conversation you’ve started. This can be making jokes, or imparting you with their wisdom. These are the best comment sections as probably you won’t catch any hate (which feels good as the rest of them you are somewhat a sacrificial lamb) but they are less easy to manufacture. Getting people to make jokes is very difficult.

Now it can be done by asking a direct question. But this is just hard, and very dependent on the perfect storm of people who get it. Unless you’re really on the nose, like asking ‘your superhero name is the last thing you ate + man’., getting them to add insight is much easier. 

The same principle kind of applies to both. You just need to intentionally miss something out. Miss out the obvious joke. Miss out a key piece of information and people will JUMP at the chance to educate you, and prove that they - in fact - know more. And you, and everyone else who didn’t comment, are in fact stupid and uneducated. This is similar to the first one, but instead of getting it actively wrong, you’re just not saying it. Which is why it *tends* to be more positive. People are often ‘trying’ to be helpful (although it does feel a little passive agressive and condescending sometimes).

So many, many ways to optimise for different types of comment section. Slightly different hacks for each, so it’s always worth having a quick read through your scripts at the end of writing them, and seeing whether there’s something small you can add, that will inspire one of these four reactions. But again. Please don’t do this every time. Use this sparingly. 

Hacks will get you huge growth, but won’t necessarily build community. Use them sparingly to boost a few videos, but as they CAN create bad will, so only pull these out when your views are a little down and you need a banger video, or if you can do it INCREDIBLY subtly. 

OR if you can handle the comment sections well. There’s an upcoming module on how you can be in active in the comment section you created, to optimise it for community building, damage control, and likeability. 

### Optimising scripts for conversion

Now we’re going to talk about how to optimise your script for conversion. Whether that’s conversion to followers, conversion to your page, to another platform, to your lead magnet PDF, to your newsletter, to buy your new book, to your company website. There are SO many things you can convert them to (that we will cover in a lot of detail in the conversion section). But this section will cover on how to optimise your SCRIPT to convert. Doesn’t matter what you’re converting to. 

It’s all about your CTA - or your ‘Call To Action’, how you word it, and where you put it. 

A lot of people, especially beginners, make the mistake of putting their CTA  right at the end of the video. After some long winded conclusion, , asking people to follow, asking them to like the video, sign up to their newsletter, buy the PDF - whatever it is. This is bad for two reasons. Firstly, by the end of the video, a huge chunk of viewers have already left - so noone is there to actually hear your CTA, let alone follow it.

Second. Those who are still there will **definitely leave** because there’s no open curioisity loop to keep them watching. And watching a CTA is the most painful thing you can put the audience through. So if in their eyes the video is finished, what reason do they have to stay to the end, and listen to you -essentially- try and sell them something? None. it’s boring and it’s corporate. Two of the three cardinal sins. 

So getting this placement wrong will mess up your retention, as there will be a huge drop off, and your % complete watch time. AND noone will follow your CTA. It’s lose-lose. 

So if you want people to stay for the CTA, you need to weave it into the video through a CTA sandwich, rather than just dumping it at the end.

The best place to put it, is around 80% of the way into the video, just after you’ve rehooked, and just before you’re about to close a curiosity loop. 

For example. If you’re doing a ‘top 5 biggest mistakes video’. You’ve done the first four mistake and you set up that 5 is gonna be the biggest mistake of them all. But, before I get to that, I’m a small creator, please drop me a follow. Anyway - number 5! 

This works as people can see the value of staying those extra few seconds, and will actually listen to your CTA. And the more people that listen to it, the more that are actually likely to act on it. 

It doesn’t just have to be a listicle. Let’s say you’re 2 minutes into a storytime about someone’s toxic manager, they’ve listed all these things they’ve done - that are seemingly normal and not that toxic - but you’re right at the end and then you get the rehook ‘so why did that mean I sued them’?. There’s so much sunk time and curiosity you have to listen to stay till the end. And then they hit you with ‘I’ll get to that but first, if you liked this video you’ll LOVE my newsletter, subsribe in the link in my bio’ ANYWAY so I sued him because…’

It’s perfect, if people hve already wasted 2 minutes of their life on your video, and you’ve given them a juicy rehook. Then why not watch for 2 and a half minutes. But if they’ve only been watching for 30 seconds and you’re already trying to sell them something? They have no alleigance to you, and that CTA could make them scroll. 

If you’ve just watched the script boulder section, that’s exactly relevant here.  You have to perceive a viewer trying to watch your tiktok as an uphill battle. They don’t want to stay. They don’t like staying, and want to scroll on for more dopamine hits. And anytime you make it even a little boring or difficult for them to stay, you take away a potential dopamine hit and increase the probability of them leaving. CTAs are very important, but they’re also probably whatever the opposite of a dopamine hit is for the average viewer. So you’ve got to give them some momentum to get through it. 

### Optimising for completed watch time

So we’ve optimised for a bunch of different comments, and conversion, and now finally lets do it for percentage completed watch time. Although optimising for every metric in your video is important, as we covered in metrics, I’m talking about this one in particular detail in the scripting section, as A LOT of new scripters don’t think about it and mess it up by accident. 

What I’m talking about, is a conclusion. 

Conclusions and summaries are a very normal part of natural conversation, of speeches, of blog posts, linkedin posts, youtube videos, emails, everything. There is a reason chatGPT puts a conclusion at the end of EVERYTHING IT SAYS. it’s because over half of the copy on the internet ends in a conclusion. 

You should not do this on short form. Conclusions are one of the BIGGEST retention killers, as people get the gist, they know what you’re saying, they’ve just listened to you say it (and if you followed all the rules it will be completely simple, understandable, and not be in need of a conclusion). A good script only needs to be said once to be understood, it’s basically all just one big conclusion. So needlessly summarising what you said at the end, is guaranteed to lose anyone who is still around. Which will mess up your percentage completed watch time. 

So no summaries. 

Lucily, there’s actually a way to OPTIMISE for completed watch time in your script. And that’s by ending on your hook so that your video loops. You see this one all the time on short form, especially on podcast clips. 
And its scriptable.

Let’s say you’re watching a video on how to make a clay pot, and the video starts with someone throwing a finished clay design against their wall saying ‘always throw the clay on the wall first, as it…’ whatever, and then the video gets to them making the pot. 

Then you get to the end, and they finish off with hey ‘**and that’s why I always** throw the clay on the wall first’ it loops back to the hook. 

There is a strange psychology of people not wanting to watch to the end. If they can see the video is about to wrap up, they leave. It’s like how you always pause the microwave just before the timer is about to go off. 
So using the hack of ending with ‘and that’s why I always..’ stops any possibility of people leaving early, as they think there’s more to come. 

To film this so it flows smoothly. Film the ‘hook/end’ at the end. And then just cut it in the edit, so it starts with the second half. 

So. Optimising for comments, conversion, and completed watch time. Three simple things you can do to take your scripts, and your engagement to the next level.
