Now video editing can look intimidating when you’re starting out but believe me, it’s a super simple process that apps like Capcut and programmes like Davinci have made incredibly accessible. 

And even then if you’re not interested in editing your videos in anything other than the apps themselves, that’s okay. You’ll be limited in what you can do but they're still pretty good at the basics. 

Now, unless you’re filming your videos in one single take, in perfect settings and you don’t want any backing music or additional media involved. You’ll have to do some kind of editing 

## Capcut

After opening CapCut, create a new project by tapping the 'New Project' button. Import your video clips by selecting them from your camera roll. You can select multiple clips and they'll appear next to each other on this *SHOW TIMELINE* your timeline. 

This timeline at the bottom of your screen is where the magic happens. You can trim clips by dragging their edges, split them in to multiple clips by tapping the, you guessed it, split icon, or delete unwanted sections. To rearrange clips, simply press and hold to drag them to a new position.

When you're satisfied with your edit, maybe you’ve removed a line you didn't like, you’ve swapped around a section or you’ve reordered the footage to lead with the most exciting line. You tap the export button. This is where you choose your preferred resolution and frame rate. Now if you’re coming from a place of complete ignorance too all of these things, dont worry it’s really simple. Your resolution is essentially the quality of your exported video and your frame rate is how many single images make up 1 whole second of footage. The more images, the smoother the footage looks but past 24 If you film with it set to 60fps you’ll have that choice but in general, 30fps will be completely fine. 

For social media, 1080p at 30fps usually works well. Save your video, and it's ready to share!

That is literally the basics but you can do a hell of a lot with just that. 

## Enhancing Your Video

Use the editing tools to adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation. Add text overlays for captions or titles, and experiment with stickers and effects 

Transitions

by adding transitions between clips you can sometimes you can blah blah blah. Access the transitions menu and choose from options like fade, slide, or flash. Simply drag your chosen transition between two clips.

Audio

Add background music from CapCut's library or import your own. Adjust volume levels between your video's original audio and background music for the perfect balance. Use the voice effects to enhance any voiceovers.

## Pro Tips

Remember to keep your edits clean and purposeful. Short, punchy cuts work well for social media. Use trending effects thoughtfully, and always preview your video before exporting.
