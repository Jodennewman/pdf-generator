Hello! There is some potential that this is the first time you’ve ever seen me.

And if you’re here, welcome to the best bit of the course. 

My name’s Alex, I cofounded Clash with Joden and I work on all things that keep this machine running. Primarily, at clash we’ve created a lean team of video specialists that put out 160 videos per month. It’s a tight operation and something unheard of in agency world until recently. But when I appear, on this course, that’s generally what I’m going to be talking you through.

Let’s get into it

So, we’ve taught you everything we know about gaining attention with short form video. 

This module is all about what to do with that attention.

Converting a stranger from follower, to fan, to paying customer is all down to constructing an efficient funnel.

Converting a stranger into a paying customer rarely happens overnight, and the funnel that does that is the most important part of any business. 

Having an effective funnel is the difference between someone who gets views, and someone who is operating a one to many business at scale.

In this module we’ll teach you everything you need to know about building that funnel to maximise conversions.

So, in this course we’ve already covered:

- Taking an audience from stranger to follower via short form content

And, we’ll take it several steps further, by covering:

- How to make a follower a fan through long form content
- How to make a fan a lead through lead magnets and your newsletter
- How to turn a lead into a customer through the final sales push

Ultimately, this module is the key to turn your following into a living, lets get started.
