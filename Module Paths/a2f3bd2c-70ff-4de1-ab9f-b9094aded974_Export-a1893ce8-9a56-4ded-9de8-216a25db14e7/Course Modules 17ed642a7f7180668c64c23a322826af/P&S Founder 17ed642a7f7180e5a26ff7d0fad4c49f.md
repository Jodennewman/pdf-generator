Community management is a huge part of what makes a great channel. 

Imagine a page, with well crafted videos, hitting perfect hooks, a great setup and perfect lighting. In the comments, people try to interact. But the creator says nothing.

Now imagine the same page, but the creator is interacting

→ 5 comments become 10

→ conversation is sparked

→ discussion is led in the right direction.

Once you’ve put all the hard work into making great videos, it is essential you interact with the community that sees it. Not only does it build your community, we have seen statistically videos do far better when the creator engages. 

So, as a busy founder, focused on running a business how do you manage posting, scheduling and community management?

Whether your working with a team or by yourself, you will want to time block an hour per week to schedule your videos

Use **METRICOOL** as a scheduler, and post at a time that makes sense for your audience.

We do a lot of business content, so our post time is between 5-6:30 when our demographic gets off from work. If your content is younger leaning, you might consider taking that earlier to when schools finished.

Crucially, you should never automatically schedule posts. Metricool has a feature where it will send your phone a notification containing the video and text at the scheduled time for you to post manually. We’ve found manual posting does significantly better, so time block your day, or get your producer or VA to do this for you.

There are a lot of misconceptions around posting. Fundamentally, your post time, frequency, hashtags or whatever else are a very small part of the picture. 

Good content does well. Almost without fail, so focus on the fundamentals of what makes a good video, and treat anyone who says different hashtags will get you a million views or similar quick fix with a healthy dose of scepticism.

To put this to bed heres our take on the basics:

1. Posting time might marginally help if your posting at the right time for your audience, as mentioned above.
2. Posting every day is what we recommend simply because it allows you to run more experiments and build momentum quickly. 
3. Hashtags and your caption are useful tools for SEO. If people search a type of video, your video will rank higher if you use a related hashtag. Joden for example did a video on Tiktoks’ biggest creators, and now if you search “big creator” his video comes up number 1.
4. Trending sounds only work if you have something relevant to add to a trend. never copy a trend verbatim without adding something of value to it.
5. Production quality is useful to convey authority, but not essential.
6. Going viral is not luck as many will say. It’s a combination of several subtle factors that we discuss at length.

CAPTIONS

Part of your scheduling process will be writing captions. A caption is secondary to the text hook in your video but still very important. Many people will look at the caption before they scroll, so its a final opportunity to rehook your viewer and save them

A caption should never feel

- conclusionary
- objectionable

The caption is a chance to show your a human, make a joke, or inspire comments through questions.

POSTING & COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT

Once you’ve posted, make sure your team, or you have set aside 10 minutes to reply to the first 5 comments. Keep comment replies playful and “in the know”. There’s nothing worse than generic replies “thanks Julia!” so if you are outsourcing comments, make sure the person you work with has a good grip on you, your humour and the brand your trying to build.
