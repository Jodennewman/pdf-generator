In this module, we’ll take the fundamentals of authority-building and apply them specifically to short-form content. You’ll discover how to become “the guy who…” in your niche, weave your credentials into storytelling, and develop a memorable on-screen persona. If you’re ready to elevate your visibility on TikTok, Reels, or YouTube Shorts—and leverage that visibility into bigger opportunities—this is for you.

This module is all abut authority - becoming a memorable and respected voice in your niche through your short form content. 

Now becoming an authority ON the app, is key to building your authority off the app. With our clients we’ve seen it time and time again where building a solid identity and brand on short form, will build authority and opportunity off the app. It can get you more business, book deals, further your personal brand, and even get you speaking engagements. 

This is how to do it.

Now the thing about LinkedIn is that authority is obvious - immediately. All because of this button right here - that says your title and your bio above every post. 

On short form platforms however, until you get verified and get this blue tick here. You hold no authority. All the audience gets is your name. They have no idea who you are — especially if you’re not a recognised face yet. So your authority needs to be baked into every video.

There are three main things to think about when building authority on short form platforms. 

The first part of establishing authority on short form is getting your name out there through subtle bragging. 

Basically constantly telling your audience who you are, what you do, and what your big accolades are. And the aim is to do this in a way that isn’t overly cringe and still gets the point across of ‘who you are’ and ‘why the viewer should listen to you’.

One way to do this, I like to call the insecure teenager hack: Take yourself back to being 15 years old, you’ve just started going to the gym and you need to make sure EVERYONE knows about it. How do you do that? You slip it into conversation ‘nonchalantly’ at every possible opportunity. ‘Oh you’re going to the shop?’ ‘Damn I wish I could come but my legs are aching SO MUCH from going to the GYM’. 

On short form, you’ve got to brag in exactly the same way. Slipping in things like:

’My cofounder hated when I did this - but it did get us a billion dollar valuation’ 

‘And what makes this even worse, is I made this mistake when I was directing a Nike campaign’ 

or even more on the nose:

‘10 things I learnt scaling my business to 9 figures in 10 years, that you can have for free in 30 seconds’

It’s bragging, but through storytelling. And surprisingly people on short form platforms don’t notice as much as you’d think. And will respect you more for doing it - because they know who you are. Making a video on ‘10 things I learnt scaling my business’ won’t hit the same if people don’t know what business, or how impressive it is. 

Things is something unique you all have as founders. You actually have something to brag about - which most creators on short form don’t. 

So brag. 

Just try to not do it in EVERY video - as it might start to piss people off. 

Another great way to get your authority across is through setting, costume, props. White coat syndrome works, so use it to your advantage. 

If you’re a mathematician, have a big black board behind you. If you’re an interior designer, have a fancy room behind you. 

This one comes with a huge caveat though. Remember cardinal sin number three - being corporate? Don’t make that mistake. So if the only ‘white coat’ equivalent for you is wearing a suit, or filming in an office - don’t do it. It will make the video worse. 

The third, and maybe the most important part of building actual on screen authority. Is being unique. Specifically unique enough, that people can talk about you to their friends, through a single sentence ‘you know the guy who’..

One of the biggest mistakes new creators make is just being the same as everyone else. On linkedin every can repost or talk about pretty much the same thing, and still grow a profile. On short form - this is not the approach. 

Obviously we’ve talked a lot about pre validated content, and how important it is to leverage videos that have already done well. BUT if your audience sees you as just “one of those people who makes finance videos” or “one of those guys who does marketing tips,” you become **replaceable**. You don’t command enough authority on app, and your growth on the platform will stagnate.

So the goal is to carve out a unique positioning. It’s to become ‘the guy who’ instead of one of the ‘guys who’. For example - the girl who ‘stops people on the street and reviews their bank accounts’ or that guy who ‘analyses PR takedowns’.

So how do you become ‘the guy who?’

It’s really all to do with your format. Coming up with a unique format - and therefore a unique bucket - will get you to this status. 

Like - the guy who guesses peoples jobs on a ladder - [Max Klymenko](https://www.tiktok.com/@maxklymenko?lang=en)

or The funny guy who talks really up close to the camera in the mirror - [Jordan the stallion](https://www.tiktok.com/@jordan_the_stallion8)

So quick refresher from the data led strategy section. A format is just all of the stuff around of what you say. It could be presenting it as a game, filming from a camera angle, or even just an editing style. It just has to be something **new** that’s unique to you, and repeatable again and again and again with loads of different topics and examples.

Now finding this unique format will not come immediately (unless you get extremely lucky) so if you’re just staring out, don’t try and do it straight away.  It’s important to start off testing the waters, throwing stuff out and seeing what works for you and what gets views. Then, once you’ve found stuff that sticks - keep being creative with it, adding to the idea and iterating, eventually you will find a new unique format. And can grow your profile off of it. 

Also, finding a unique format isn’t just a creative task, it’s also a research task. Have a look through all short form platforms - even the ones you’re not posting on - and think about all the ‘ones who do’ your thing. The list of people you have listed down as inspiration from the research section. Look at what are they doing differently, what **works** about their format, and why you remember them. Because it’s normally not just random, their winning format tends to work for some psychological reason that helps boost engagement or retention. So have a look at what other people do, and what the good parts are that you can take to create a format that is completely unique and hasn’t been done before. 

### 

So the three steps to building an authority on tiktok. First, just brag about yourself as much as possible (without people noticing). Second, tyr and use your background, staging and clothing (where possible) to visually key your importance. And third, find a unique format no-one else is doing to talk about your niche. 

Just remember. Short form audiences care about authenticity. If it looks like a subtle brag it’s ok. if it looks like showing off - it definitely isn’t
