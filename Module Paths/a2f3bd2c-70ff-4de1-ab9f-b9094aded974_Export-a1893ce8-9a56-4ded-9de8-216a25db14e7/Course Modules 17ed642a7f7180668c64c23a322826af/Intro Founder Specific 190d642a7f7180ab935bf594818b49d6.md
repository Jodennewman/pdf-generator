If you’re watching this, I’m dead… excited to introduce you to the Vertical Shortcut. Welcome. 

In the next, 50 or so hours - you’ll get very familiar with my face - we’ll cover all things short-form — how it important it is for you brand, your business, and most importantly - how to actually go viral, consistently.

In the past two years, the Clash Team, [so that’s myself Joden, my cofounder ALex, our producer Aydan and our writer Tia and our two editors Glen and Faiqa]. Together we’ve worked with a handful of incredible founders, names you might know already like Chris Donelly, Charltote Mair, Jordan Schwarzenger, Ben Askins, just to name a few, and together we’ve racked up **750 million views** and more than **5 million followers. In just two years.** 

From our research, that makes us the **#1 short form agency in the UK which is a bit insane** (and we think possibly in the world too)

So you’re in safe hands.  

Let’s get into talking about the course. What you’re watching right now is the product of 6 months of blood sweat and tears. 

It’s the amalgamation of everything we’ve learnt about the algorithms, everything we’ve learnt about making a GREAT final product, and everything we’ve learnt about efficiency — It’s all well and good knowing how to make a great video, but being able to do it FAST - is probably the most important thing we’ve worked out. And I’m sure you’re excited to learn it all. 

So all in all the vertical shortcut is just over 50 hours of lectures, workshops, tutorials, PDFs, worked examples, and walkthroughs written, created and delivered by us - the clash team. And for those on the premium tier, we’ve also chucked in our entire in-house operating system so your content engine can run as efficiently as ours. 

Your question now is probably: sounds great, but how long is this all gonna take? 

Well we’ll start you off in the deep end with all the theory — and we assume this will take you 2-3 weeks, to fully get your head round it all. It’s pretty comprehensive. 

We’ll walk you through the demystification of the algorithm, how to read engagement metrics and optimise for them. How to understand attention, and use that for resaerch, scripting, and repurposing other content for short form. Don’t worry, this is all taught through lectures AND workshops AND worksheets, it’s not just me shouting theory at you for hours. *There’ll be some of us yapping at you too [clash team waves*]. Then once you’ve got short form theory covered- we take all of that learning, and will use it build a viral optimised short form strategy that’s personalised TO YOU. 

The next question. Is how the hell you actually turn that strategy, into a reality.

Which is luckily what the rest of the course covers. 

The next section, we’ll assume with take 2-4 weeks, depending on the size and skill of the team you have. 

We’ll start off here with filming. That is, how to set up a studio, how to get the lighting right, what equipment to buy, cameras etc. Plus How to deliver it all well if you’re not that used to being on camera. Then after that, we’ll get into the ALL of the bespoke editing techniques, processes and sequences designed by myself - that will take your videos from good to GREAT. This was probably the hardest bit for me to part with. It is incredibly valuable. Your team, and your numbers, will thank you. 

And then, if that wasn’t all enough, to wrap it all up. We’ll explain all the best ways, the how to, the top tips, to make a shit ton of money from  all this - to either go back into the business, or your pockets - your choice. 

So, yes, loads to look forward to. 

But just before we get into it. 

I want to have a serious chat with you short form, and the current state of your personal brand. 

Now I know you wouldn’t be here if you weren’t convinced short form could be transformational to your business. 

But I need to tell you that this is not just transformations, it is the MOST exciting and the most IMPORTANT investment in your business you’ve ever made. 

Short form/ vertical video - as we know it, has only really been around, since 2020. So as of recording, that’s 5 years. 

But in that short space of time it has grown an INSANE amount. 62.6% of the global population is currently on social media, that’s well over 5 billion people, and each of them spends around 2 and a half hours on there. Every single day. 5 billion people watching for 2 and a half hours.

Short form is where the attention is. 

And it’s also where people are BUYING. 

Studies show that 96% of all consumers prefer video over text when learning about a product or a service, and 73% of those consumers prefer to learn about it through **short form v**ideo specifiically. 

So if you have a product - and yes that product can be yourself - short form is the only reasonable place to start dominating. 

And if you’re trying to target genZ? You’d be stupid not to be on here. 70% of them watch short form videos every single day, this is the place to reach them. 

Now for the hard part.

I am frankly upset about the number of founders, incredibly talented and inspirational people, with something to say, who’s short form presence is… dismal. It’s bland and corporate and it doesn’t cut through. 

And I find this really frustrating, as I’m sure you do too. Beause most people on social media, most content creators - have nothing to say. Other than what they ate that day, or what they’re wearing. 

And the people who do have something to say - aren’tbeing listened to. 

So that’s what we’re here for, and that’s really what this course is designed to fix. 

From working, almost exclusively, with founder and brands, at Clash we’ve worked out how to turn linkedin style entreprueniral success, into short form succces. We’ve cracked how to repackage your messaging so that it’s entertaining, and viral. Without compromising on who you are. 

This is our expertise. And we’re really excited to share EXACTLY how to do that, so you can do it too, over the next few weeks.

Excited? You should be
