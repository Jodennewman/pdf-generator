# Script

Speaking is an incredible way to get seen by decision makers, become a voice that stands out, and rocket your credibility.

Historically, speakers have had a clear body of work that demonstrated their knowledge and authority on a topic. 

They had written books, or exited companies, or lived in a crevice for 3 days.

All experiences they had survived and were able to tell the tale to corporate audiences, making them THE go to authority on their given topic.

But now, the world has changed.

Life experiences are still the value, but content is the backstory. Every professional speaker is currently focusing on getting onto the next podcast, improving their content and reaching the next eschelon.

If your aiming to be a thought leader in your niche, its highly likely that speaking engagements are a top priority for you. 

Long term, getting an agent with connections is the ultimate goal for landing a lot of these gigs, but as you’re starting out, both agents and bookers look for new talent via social media. So this is how to make sure your pages are optimised to show exactly why you’d be fantastic:

Bookers want credible, reliable and respected people, and a thriving community around well thought out posts will help build that.

1. Post on the exact topics you’d want to be hired to speak about.
    1. you can even use this as inspiration for your scripts - what are your dream speaking engagements, who attends and what questions are they currently asking? consistently answer those questions in your content and you will find the right people
2. Keep your bios, pinned videos, and overall profile theme locked onto “the guy who” message. Much like podcasts, speakers are selected who have a strong sense of “the guy who” agents and bookers may not know you, so make it easy.
3. Use data, case studies, or personal stories that show you know exactly what your talking about in your content. This is where a content system is incredibly useful so you can think through what you’ll be posting.

Focus on linkedin, where a large professional audience resides, but use short form video of you speaking to do that. 

And finally, use podcasts to your advantage.

Podcasts are the best way to show your skill as a speaker, and practically all podcast hosts want a speaker to riff off.
