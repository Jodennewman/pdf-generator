So, you want to turn your long-form podcast into bite-sized social media gold? Let me break it down for you – and no, this isn't as painful as trying to explain TikTok to your grandparents.

First things first, when you're listening to your podcast, if you’ve followed the producing a podcast lesson you'll be able to find the clips you prepared for, but you need to pay attention incase there are any other moments that you feel would work well as there own 90 second clip. You're looking for segments that are either highly entertaining, drop some serious knowledge, or ideally both.

Keep your clips short and sweet – think 30-90 seconds max. The clip should be able to stand alone without context, like that one friend who can walk into any party and immediately fit in. You don’t want this 

For maximum engagement, look for emotional moments, controversial statements (the good kind, not the "I'm about to start a Twitter war" kind), or practical tips people can actually use. Bonus points if there's a natural hook in the first 3 seconds – that's when most people decide whether to keep watching or continue their endless scroll into the void.

Add captions. Always. Not just because it's accessible (which it is), but because 85% of social media users watch videos with the sound off. They're probably sitting in a boring meeting or pretending to pay attention to their partner's story about their day.

Finally, end with a bang – a punchline, a profound statement, or a cliffhanger. You want your audience feeling like they just watched the season finale of their favorite show, not like they just sat through a mandatory HR training video.

Remember, the goal is to make people stop scrolling and think "Okay, just one more clip" – until they've somehow watched 47 of your videos and it's 3 AM. That's when you know you've nailed it.
