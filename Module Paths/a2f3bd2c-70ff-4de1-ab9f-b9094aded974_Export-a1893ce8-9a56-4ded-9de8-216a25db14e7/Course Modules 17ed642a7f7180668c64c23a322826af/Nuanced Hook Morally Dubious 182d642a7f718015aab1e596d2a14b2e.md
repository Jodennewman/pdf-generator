    Ok Hooks. Nailing the hook is the key to nailing a viral video. Even if you’ve made the best, most creative, most valuable video of all time, if your hook is bad no-one will watch it. 
    
    On short form platforms, most people seeing your video are seeing your face for the first time. That means they have no idea what the video is going to be about, or why they should stay on to watch it. And your hooks job is to fix this. A good hook will do this by immediately setting up **clarity, intrigue and authority** - in that order. 
    
    **Clarity**
    
    This is the simplest, and most important part of a good hook. Basically, does your hook make it immediately clear what the video is about? If not. It’s a bad hook. 
    
    **Intrigue**
    
    Intrigue is the next factor. The viewer knows what the video is going to be about, but now you need establish **why** they’d want to watch it. You need to create some intrigue. As a general rule of thumb, creating intrigue is done by creating as many questions as possible in the readers mind. I’ll explain why further, but **this** is precisely why you cannot have intrigue without clarity. You cannot have one without the other. 
    
    **Authority**
    
    The third and final factor is authority. The viewer knows what the video is about, they have a reason to keep watching, and now you need to establish why **you’re** the person they should listen to. This is the final element of the hook because it needs to come last. In general this should follow just after the hook, as leading with you, will negate the other two. The viewer needs to have a clear intriguing way into the video BEFORE you talk about yourself. 
    
    **So how do we go about achieving all three of those?** 
    
    Let’s start with the most important part of a good hook, **clarity.** 
    
    Now sadly there are no words or hacks you can use to be clear. You just have to take yourself out of your own shoes. If you were listening to this hook for the first time, with no prior knowledge of who you are or what it’s about. Would it make sense? 
    
    This means staying away from any jargon, trying to say anything too complex, or just trying to be too whacky. It has to be immediately clear, in a matter of seconds, what is being said. 
    
    like if its a video on the top 5 most tragic accidents to happen on a film set. Start the video of by saying ‘these are 5 most TRAGIC accidents to happen on a film set’. It’s really not rocket science to be clear. Just something to keep in mind. 
    
    A lot of first timers on short form think the hook is some ephemeral, algorithm-optimised weird thing you need to learn (or worse, find on a list of ‘hook cheat sheets’) but it’s much more simple. It just needs to tell the viewer why the fuck they should keep watching. 
    
    It’s important to think here too, about not just what you’re saying, but what is going on on screen. There are two other key elements to a hook. The text hook (the words on screen) and the visual hook (what you’re doing/ whatever else is in the image in the first few frames).
    
    I’ll cover these in more detail a bit later. But they’re important to mention now, in clarity, as you need to remember the viewer is processing all three. So these need to be simple and understandable within 1 second maximum. Just like I said in the cardinal sins section. If your viewer gets confused - they are GONE. 
    
    Ok so the next part, interestingly the most misunderstood part of the hook, **intrigue.** 
    
    Why is the viewer going to keep watching your video? Well, it’s because they want a question answered. And the more questions you ask - considering it is still **clear what the video is about** - the more they are going to keep wanting to watch. The more *intrigued* they’ll be. 
    
    Now this is what people fundamently misunderstand. They think intrigue means mystery, not knowing what’s going on. But mystery is too confusing for short form. On here to actually acheive intrigue, you need to add just the right amount of context. 
    
    The equation isn’t just more questions = more intrigue. It’s more details = more questions = more intrigue. 
    
    Let’s go through a quick example. Think about this hook for a second - ‘Do you want to hear the craziest thing that ever happened to me?’ 
    
    Now this hook is, ok, it clearly sets the stage for a story, promises some pay off. We’ve got clarity (you’re gonna tell a crazy story). But what questions does it actually ask? Well, one, which is :what’s the craziest thing that happened to you?’
    
    This might seem intriguing at the face of it. But in reality it’s too vague. So we need to add more details, to make it more intriguing. 
    
    Now what about this hook:
    
    ‘Did I ever tell you about the time I got locked up in a swiss prison for treason?’. 
    
    Off the bat. I am hooked. Why is it so much better than the first one? Let’s look at the details. Early on we’re given way more information, we know its about switzerland, set in prison, there’s something to do with treason going on. And that means there’s WAY more questions in the viewers mind. Off the top of the video I’m already asking myself:
    
    Why were you in Switzerland? why did you get locked up? For how long? what did you do? why treason? do Switzerland even have a royal family? 
    
    I’ve got way more questions, because I’ve got more to work with. And it makes me want to watch the video, because I want all of them answered. And if you get the script right, I will definitely watch to the end. 
    
    It’s the perfect balance of intriguing, but still clear. You cannot have one without the other. 
    
    The third part of the hook, is **authority.** 
    
    Again, misunderstood. Starting off your video with ‘hi I’m a lawyer and I’m going to talk about a guilty client I defended’ is an almost guaranteed flop. 
    
    But ‘I defended a guilty client, and now I’m partner at a major law firm’ is almost guaranteed viral (as long as the story’s any good). As a viewer I’m not going anywhere. And it’s because you’ve added clarity and intrigue - you’re about to tell a crazy story and I have a lot of questions about it. And, you’ve provided authority. You’re a major partner at a law firm - the viewer knows you’re smart and so they should listen to you. 
    
    Now authority is especially important, for newer accounts. But even is when you’ve got millions of followers. In general on these algorithms your video is going to go to way more strangers than followers. And even your followers might forget who you are. So you need to get this in early. 
    
    This is an issue I see a lot with people who are big on other platforms, like many of you may be on linkedin, when moving to short form. You’ll decide to make a video about your business regrets, and start it off with something like ‘If I had to go and start my business alll over again, here’s what I’d do’. It’s an interesting concept - but a terrible hook - because no one on these short form platforms knows you who are. So why should they care about your business? White coat syndrome on these platforms is real. 
    
    Now a key difference between short form platforms, and platforms like linkedin, is this right here [point at title tag]. On linkedin your authority is clear straight away. On tiktok, they’ve just got your name, and you’re probably not as famous as your linkedin followers might have you think. So you have to say it. 
    
    To get this across effectively, there’s a couple tricks. The first I like to call the ‘insecure teenager’ hack. Imagine you’re a cringe 14 year old who’s just started going to the gym, and you need to make sure EVERYONE knows about it. And I mean everyone, so you’ll slip it into conversation ‘nonchalantly’ in any way possible. ‘Oh you’re going to the shop? Aw I wish I could come but my legs are aching so much from going to the GYM’. 
    
    On short form you need to do exactly that. ‘These are the 5 most EMBARRASSING things to say in a meeting, and as a founder and CEO myself, I’m definitely guilty of the last one’
    
    Just subtly adding in your title, or the value of your business, or just something that sounds very impressive very ‘nonchalantly’ will make a huge difference. 
    
    Just please don’t start with ‘Hi my name is ‘ at the beginning. 
    
    The second way to establish authority early. Is through the visuals. If you’re a doctor - literally please wear a white coat. If you’re a mathematician. Have a blackboard behind you. props, staging, and your outfit can make a huge difference. And sometimes you might want this to look lo-fi. Like if you’re a founder please don’t wear a suit - we are still trying to **not be corporate**. But if you have any way to visually show who you are, in a way that is subtle. Please do it. One good way is just to have a nice looking home in the background. It shows you have money, so you must be good at business. 
    
    In general these platforms, are superficial. But you can go over the top with this and it feels cringe. So try and keep this authority part balanced. Don’t show off, people will hate it. 
    
    Just remember to slip in who you are and what you do into the first third of the video - ideally earlier on if it fits naturally. Master the humble brag. 
    
    So. Clarity first. Intrigue second. Authority third. If you find a way to bake all three of these into your hook, you’re already off to a great start. 
    
    **The Rest of the Hook: visual and text**
    
    So I mentioned earlier in the clarity section of this module, the visual hook, and the text hook. 
    
    Let’s go through text hook first. 
    
    The text hook is basically what’s written on screen. An this is often really overlooked but actually makes a really big difference. Because people tend to read the text hook before they hear what you’re saying. This is especially true if they’re watching short form on mute - which a surprising amount of people do - especially on instagram and it’s actually their default setting on desktop.
    
    So in general your text hook should ADD something to your verbal hook. That could be adding more context (for clarity) or more intrigue (a sign that something else is coming later), or just another question (more questions = more intrigue). But in general i think text hooks are best to add more context, and more clarity, so you can use your verbal hook for the fun stuff. 
    
    Plus again. You don’t want to confuse your viewer. If there’s too much going on, and what you’re saying and seeing don’t add up and just overwhelm, they’ll be gone. 
    
    In general when writing a good text hook you want it short and effective. 5 words, capitalise the main one, don’t overwhelm. 
    
    5 most EXPENSIVE mistakes 
    
    How I lost MILLIONS 
    This tool will CHANGE your LIFE 
    
    That kind of thing. Just keep it plain, don’t go nuts with it. But remember it’s still got to hit the overall beats of clarity, intrigue and authority. 
    
    Ok so the next part, and don’t worry the final part, of a hook, is the visual hook. Now this isn’t a must have, many videos manage on just a verbal and a text hook alone. But the visual hook is still important to know about. 
    
    A visual hook is basically a signifier of a visual payoff that doesn’t require words. Think a guy holding a basketball in front of the screen, with a hoop in the background. It’s pretty clear he is going to throw it into the hoop at some point in the video. And this is enough for people keep watching. it’s a visual hook. It’s typically wordless. And just implies some pay off. 
    A great way people do this is through greenscreens. You can see a picture or article in the background that they are clearly going to talk about. Or one of the best ones for short form. A notes app in the background with a bunch of points, that you’re mainly covering up with your head. It’s clear you’re going to do a list and the viewer wants to see the words your head is half covering up. It’s a great way to set up intrigue and clarity without even having to say it. which may give you more choice to be creative. 
    
    Introducing some kind of prop, like holding something atypical as a microphone, or having something else going on the screen (other than your face) - like a greenscreen, or even you doing the washing up is a best way to keep people hooked visually. But it can also be something like movement. Sitting down into your chair, moving around. Now all of this, is very stealable. There are clear visual hook trends you see going around that you can tap into. 
    
    or you can create your own, and achieve that magic of being ‘the person who’. You know that australian girl who cuts fruit and talks? That’s all in a visual hook. [find account] 
    You know that guy who comes in really close to the camera and films himsefl in the mirror [find account] Again, that’s the visual hook. 
    
    If you can come up with a unique one that you stick to every time, and it works, it’s a HUGE growth hack. 
    
    So you’ve got to balance verbal hook, text hook and visual hook. How? 
    
    Well, in general when scripting and ideating. I’d suggest doing all three at once. The pitfall people fall into when trying to do all three is being confusing. So I’d make sure you have an idea in mind before you make the video of what the screen will look like, what text is on there, and what the person is saying. That way you can work out early on what combination makes sense and which ones complement each other best, so those core elements are coming across. 
    
    So clarity, intrigue, authority. You can get all three in the verbal hook. Or you can get one in the verbal, one in the text and one in the visual. Honestly it is up to you. But just remember they exist in that order only. And you can’t one without the other.  
    

I know i’ve said I HATE hack lists and templates, and that you should avoid them at all costs. But here are five hook structures you should think about using. 

So the reason I hate lists is because they’re trend based - they work the first time they’re used because noone has ever seen them before, so they grab attention. Then people catch on, they end up on some ‘hook formula list’ and suddenly everyone is using them. At this point they stop working, because tiktok is oversaturated with the same few hooks. It’s like any trend, it works for the creators or early adopters and flops for everyone else. Novelty is deeply underrated in a good hook, as it’s key in bringing out intrigue — once you’ve already seen in 10 times you know where they’re going. So we want the hook to feel fresh, new, not a copy. 

But that doesn’t mean there aren’t structures tha make a good hook. There are, these are 5 ‘loose templates’ that will be evergreen, and have been for the years I’ve orked on these platforms. This is because they’re naturally intriguing, they play on human psychology, and they’re incredibly adaptable. Not just a combination of ‘words that hook people’. 

Let’s just get straight in.

 

So the first type of evergreen hook structure, is the: Big Small 

‘This is how a spare tire and this candle stick become a multi billion dollar business’

‘3.9 billion people were locked in their houses, all because of this one bat’ 

‘I lost 25 years of work, in 23 seconds - here’s how’

This is the easiest type of hook to replicate, and works every.single.time. 

How did something so small, become so big? OR how did something so big become so small? 

The big small is the perfect ‘storytime hook’. It tees up a clear beginning, and end. And all the viewer wants is find out is the middle - which is then your entire video. It sets up a question that makes the viewer need to engage with the whole video, to get the satisfaction. As they need to see what the combination is. 

To write this kind of hook, find two extreme parts about your story, a big number or a big statement, and a tiny insignificant or amusing one. See if there’s a way to piece these together to ‘frame’ your script. Don’t worry if the link isn’t direct, people will watch it anyway, and you can find a way to shoe horn it in. 

The second type of viral hook template is the False Assumption 

‘So we all know what really happened with Lady Gaga and T-Pain, but what I actualy want to talk about is…’

‘You all remember what happened with *that guy* - and.. I think I might take him back’

‘So we’ve all seen that lady wearing the green dress’

This hook structure works as it’s playing on FOMO - fear of missing out. To the viewer it feels like you’re entering a conversation at a party half way through, and everyone’s talking and laughing about the same thing- wait, what happened, how did you get there - PLEASE GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING. 

People will stay to the end to hear what you were actually talk about so they can be part of the club. The way to be really hacky with this one, is to maybe very lightly mention the the hook in the script, but in general leave it as unrewsolved as you can. By leaving it unanswered people in your comments will JUMP to ask it to you, they’ll go onto your profile to try and work it out for themselves.  OR people will go researching themselves, searching terms like ‘gaga tpain drama’ or ‘lady green dress’ that mean you’ll end up with a blue comment. This is a great sign of a viral video, and a very underrated metric that the algorithm loves. If your video prompts people to search other videos, and go down more rabbit holes on the app - the algorithm WILL push it.  

To come up with this one, you can jump onto a relevant discussion in pop culture. You can jump onto a discussion you’ve been having with your community (so it feel slike a special club everyone wants to be part of) OR you can just completely fabricate it for fun - just make sure it comes across as tongue in cheek, and you address it later with comment damage control (which we’ll talk about in that module later).

The third type of viral hook, is the impossible question:

‘Is the mona lisa actually, a man?’ 

‘Are blueberries worse for your health than smoking?’

‘is the earth actually flat?’

This structure works as the intrigue isn’t ‘what’s the answer to this question?’ if you have half a brain cell the answer is very clearly no. The intrigue is instead ‘WHY are you asking that question?’ ‘What’s the link  here, what’s your point?’ ‘How are you going to make those connect?’ It’s almost like you’re starting at the conclusion, and people want to work out the thinking of how you got there. Which will keep people watching the video. 
To come up with this one, try and think of a question adjacent to the central question/ conflict/theme in your video, that is sensational and controversial. If you want to stay away from clikcbait territory you can then follow it up with ‘Well no, but THIS is’. or you can keep people hanging right until the very end. 
Remember it is more ‘morally dubious’ but the less you address, the more people will engage. 

The fourth type of evergreen hook is the: Lightheared Contrarian Statement. 
Something along the lines of 

‘Beyonce is overrated’ 

‘Interstellar is a bad film’ 

‘It’s ok to miss your best friends birthday’ 

This structure works as it sparks an emotional reaction in people. It’s rage bait but - lighthearted. And means everyone watching will JUMP at the opportunity to tell you what you’ve said is incorrect, and that **they** have the right opinion instead. And then some people who support you will fight them in the comments. It sparks conversation and debates. 

Now with these statements, you don’t even have to stand by it to say it. As long as it’s playful and lighthearted, you can get away with it. or you can soften it a bit later on in the script.  

The way to write these hooks, is to look at your script and think of a controversial angle you can make about some of the topics/ people/ themes involved in the script. Or an opinion that will affect the audience you expect will watch the video. In general if the video affects fandoms, like celebrity fans, or film bros - you should definitely use one of these hooks. 

Then find a way to tie it in to the rest of the video, go back on yourself, and it will still capture people’s attention (and they will comment).

Then the fifth type of viral hook structure you should probably know, is the this JUST happened hook.

‘Scientist JUST found this in the mariana trench’ 

‘You need to look at what’s going on on YouTube, RIGHT NOW’ 

‘This new productivity tool JUST launched and I’m so excited’ 

This is the urgency hook, and it’s a classic for a reason. It’s a staple of every headline, news segment, article, and now tiktok, because it hits the perfect combination of ego and curiosity. People love to be the FIRST to know something, they want to send it to their friends, bring it up at dinner parties, and have access to this ‘exclusive’ information. And nothing says exclusive like THIS JUST HAPPENED. It also hits curisoity, as the fact it’s ‘so recent’ implies they haven’t heard of it before, so they assume it’s new. Right like a video on productivity tools, you’ll probably think you’ve heard of it. But if it’s JUST LAUNCHED, then you probably don’t yet. 

So talking about something like it’s ONLY JUST happened will do wonders for your video — and it doesn’t have to be about the news. It also doesn’t have to be that recent. I’ve definitely taken some creative license with this one. But if it actually is new, definitely use this. 

So five different types of hook. All playing on some sort of emotional response, and psychological trick, that gets people to watch videos. 

Now if you’re keen-eyed I’m sure you’ll have noticed that to have hooks like this you’ll have to tweak your script to match. 

This is something I like to cause ‘hook-first’ scripting. And follows the same principles of a normal script. You research, you lay out your info and key talking points. But then before you polish it all off. You work out your angle THROUGH the hook. And then design the flow of your video to work off the bat of that. It might not be the most logical, or educational way to frame your video. But it WILL be the most engaging. So is worth a go, if any of these obvious hook structures work for the script you’re trying to write. 

Remember, hook is pretty much 80% of a viral video. This is what you need people to get through. So get as creative, and engaging as you can with it. Have fun.
