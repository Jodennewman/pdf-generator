Businesses will pay thousands of pounds for influencers to promote their product.

But what happens if influencers *create* a product?

In the last ten years, some of the biggest businesses in the world have been developed by creators.

And its not just because of their ability to sell to their following.

When you have a following, you are in a unique position to understand exactly what your demographic want, and how they want it. Having access to thousands of potential customers opens you up to market research and networking opportunities that were unprecedented 10 years ago.

So, the ultimate way to monetise your following, is to introduce them to your products.

It’s likely that you already have a product/service in mind if you’ve bought this course, so this is a primer on how to introduce that product to your audience, and use it to your advantage.

First, understand that the more scalable your product is, the better you can sell it to an outsized, worldwide audience.

Thats why consumer driven businesses, courses and merchandise do well. They’re setup for scale, and when partnered with an influencer with scale, you’ve got a recipe for success.

That’s not to say a b2b business wont do well out of having an owner with a strong personal brand. It will, the outsized advantage of having an owner thats a thought leader in the space means all b2b connections will be following that owner, and trusting them over their competitor.

So, for whatever path you decide to take, here’s the playbook for introducing it to your audience and sustaining flow.

1. Find alignment

Make sure your business aligns with what your known for. If it doesn’t, gently introduce content that does

This does not mean to start talking about your business more.

No.

You need to create content that relates to the customer you want to sell to. Remember, its a sin to be boring, and unless you’re willy wonka, your business probably is to most people, so generate content that does not sell to your target demographic, but gets them on side.

1. Follow the 10% rule.

Regardless of how brilliantly your business aligns with your hard won followers, remember your followers have followed you because they trust you.

You are in a parasocial relationship with them, and there are rules.

They decided to follow you because they like the free content you generate, if you push too hard towards a sale, that trust will go, quickly.

Think of followers like friends who might like to buy from you.

You would never text a friend daily saying “50% off - this offer is just for you, and I know you will love it”. Not only is this cheap, it erodes trust and feels manipulative.

But you might, after seeing them a few times, mention what you do. The friend will want to hear it as they care about you, and trust that you may hold some value for them.

Therefore with content, follow the 10% rule. No more than 10% of your content should push towards a sale.

This might feel frustrating, but with a proper lead magnet system in place, you should generate interest in what you do enough to encourage click throughs without constant CTAs, and its far better to maintain that trust than throw it away.

1. always give value before the sale

Whilst your audience may trust you in platform, they may not trust you enough to buy from you yet. Which is where a newsletter comes in. Provide free value in exchange for their email address, prove that what you do is valuable, and when it comes to sale, your audience will be far better prepped to buy.
