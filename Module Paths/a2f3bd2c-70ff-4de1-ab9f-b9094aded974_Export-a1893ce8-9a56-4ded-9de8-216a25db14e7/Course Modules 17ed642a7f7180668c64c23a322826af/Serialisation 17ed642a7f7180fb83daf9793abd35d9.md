This section is all about serialsation. How to create a series from scratch and how to create a series out of a viral video.

Series has, serious, viral potential. First because, liek we discussed with buckets, all the videos in the series are incredily similar - and the algorithm can recognise that. If someone engages with just one of on the videos in your series,the algorithm will automatically assume that they’ll enjoy the rest of the series and send ALL the other videos their way. It’s incredibly easy for it to understand who to send it to and who will enjoy it. 
Meaning one succesful video in a series - will boost ALL of the others. 

The other benefit of a series, is they can be pretty easy to make. We’ll get down to the specifics of ‘series types’ but in some you are basically doing the exact same thing in every video, making it much easier to create consistent daily content.

And finally, series are the best way to become ‘the guy who’ and build an audience and community that recognise the type of content. It’s likely to bring in fans and followers, and a lot of people will follow specifically for one of the series you make. Especially if they feel like they’re part of the series from jump. 

Let’s start with making a series from scratch. 

One of the common succesful ‘series’ types we see on short form as ‘day 1 of ‘X’’ videos:

Like ‘day 1 of polisining a rock until it shines like a mirror’ 

‘day 1 of eating my followers in beans until i’ve eaten half a million beans, you follow I eat a bean’

This type of series really had its moment a year ago, but the same principles still apply and the good ones still crop up consistently on my feed. They’re great for early on RAPID growth. They work as people want to check in every day, feel liek they’re following the journey with you. And can commment on day 48 ‘been here since day 1’. So they’re great for building fans early on. 

The best way to make one of these series, is to make it so that the audience following you or engaging with the video, will have a tangible impact on your content. LIke the eating followers in beans. I did this one for 2 days and got 10k followers in 2 days. It really works. You just have to get creative with ways the audience can impact the next part. Maybe that’s commenting to slightly change up what you do next time. Or following to make the challenge even harder. 

Just make sure when ideating for this one, if you’re going to try it, to make sure the challenge is actually scalable. The problem with beans was. It was physcially impossible for me to eat that many followers in beans every single day. 10, 000 beans is A LOT. So try and make it so the follower interaction is actually tangible. 

The next type of series that is incredibly popular, is the ‘doing X - part 1’ 

Like ‘redesigning celebrities brands - part 1 - this week Cameron Diaz’ 

Or ‘trying out my commenters favourite foods - part 1 - this week, chipotle’ 

These are great, and will keep your content much more fun and varied than the ‘day 1’ style of series. It’s the perfect way to denote to the audience that this is WHAT you do and they should follow for it - straight away in the hook by the term ‘part ‘X’’. 

If a viewer stumbles across ‘part 48’ and love it, they will very likely go to your profilel and watch all the previous 47. 

To come up with this type of series, you eitehr want something creative, like a problem or a game, that you can just keep doing - like redesigning brands, rewriting songs, desinging business plans, analysiing dragons den pitches. It’s unique and you can do it AGAIN and AGAIN. 

Or you want to come up with something that your fans can continue coming up with ideas for, LIke them deciding what you eat for dinner every night, what TV you watch, what mornign routines you try, what tools you should use. Whatever. This one is great as its lower on the creativity side (you don’t have to think much about your own content, just dip into their list of ideas)  and the commenters get a real tangible impact on you - just like the beans video. They can suggest seomthing, and see you making it. 

This principle also works with the ‘part 1 of doing a series’, as people in the commenters can suggest the next brand or celebrity or episode you include in the ext part of the series. 

So having a recurring series is guaranteeed to build community and followers. And always worth trying out early on for rapid growth. Just remember to put that its a series ‘day 1 or part 1’ in the text hook , and your verbal hook. So its very clear what’s going on immediately. 

Now the other type of series. Isn’t one you set out to do. 

Let’s say you’ve been at tihs content thing for a month and you’ve had a video do, really well. Maybe it’s gone viral, and you’re in the tens of millions of views, the milions of views, or hundreds of thousands of views. You’ve finally got the high of having the notifications rolling in on your phone. It feels great, and now you want to do it again and again and again. 

This is your guide to how to identify, and keep hitting that sweetspot of virality, whilst still switching it up and keeping it interesting. 

The first question you have to ask yourslef is: WHY. Why did it actually go viral? 

This is suprisingly difficult to answer. A lot of people just assuem it was the idea. This is a rookie error. 

You could have touched on something that generated crazy engagement - lIke using something hacky to drive comments or accidnetally making a mistake. 
it could be an excellent hook, crazy reserach, the topic, the presentation or the humour and the jokes you made in it. 

In reality, it’s probably the perfect storm of many many different factors + a little luck on the early adopters. 

But to recreate it you need to try and identify that as best you can - and no factor is off the table. 

So go through each part of the video and dissect it. Was it the hook - how did this hook differ from my other hooks? Are people talking about the hook in the comments? If not. That LEVEL of virality is caused by something different. 

in general, as i’ve said before comments are the best insight into the viewers minds. Read these, as they’ll best elucidate what you’ve done differently. 

Looking at which part of the video they’re talking about, if they’re all talking about your hook - then your hook is responsible. If they’re all talking about the topic - then it’s the topic + your hook + your script. If they’re all talking about something stupid you did - it’s that. If they’re all talking about something else entirely - then your topic has hit onto something controversial. Can you hit that in a different way again? And you’ve probably accidentally done something hacky too. 

Working this one out is the MOST important part of turnign this video into a series, so spend some proper time dissecting exactly why it went viral - as best you. an. Then lock into that. 

If you really can’t tell what worked about it. Then try as many differentl things as possible. It’s all a playground, try a part 2 on the same topic, try another bucket with the same hook. Experiment until you start to see results. 

Then once you’ve hopefully worked it out. DOUBLE DOWN. And keep it going. 

If that viral video was made through the pillars, topics, buckets strategy - and is part of a bucket - then by nature it will be much easier to come up with new ways to replicate it. 

But chuck that ‘part 2, part 3, whatever’ tag on and keep doing it. If the video is similar in a lot of ways, then the algorithm will send it to most of the people who engaged with your first viral video. Meaning it will get an early boost. So identifying how to do it again early, and capitalising on that, will skyrocket your account. Don’t miss this opportunity or the viewers will forget you and move on. 

So stage 1 of replciating is analysis. Have a look at the data led iteration section if you want to get properly into the metrics. But just take a critical eye to the content, what you’re aware of other viral content, and compare it to everything else you’ve put out - and everything else similar. 

Then stage 2 is making it again and again. And who knows, when you work out why the first one worked, each one after could keep going more and more viral. 

Then. Finally stage 3. Giving up. 

At some point viewers will get series fatigue. The idea has dried up, they’ve already seen a lot of what’s new and exciting, and they’re bored. 

At this point, you can either try and shift this series into something a little different to keep people hanging on. or give up and come up with a new one. 

If the series has been running for a long time and getting in big views. i would always suggest giving up and moving to a new one. People want novelty and you don’t want to come across as a one hit wonder, or pigeonhole yourself into one type of content. 

Take what’s worked about that previous series and see how you can creatively do it again.
