**More than ever before in human history, audiences have control over what they watch, and on these platforms, the second their subconscious gets that ‘itch’ they move on to another video.** This makes them extremely fickle to a content creator – but to a viewer it’s either a passive, effortless journey they’re going on – or something in your video (whether it be a moment that is boring or confusing) moves them out of their passive state and into their active state. At this point, engaging with your video becomes **active effort**.

The best way to illustrate this journey of passive/active viewership your audience goes through is by literally presenting that effort by imagining them **pushing a boulder from point A to point B**—point A being the start of your video, and point B the end.

Traditionally, if a viewer wanted to watch a piece of media, say read a book, they would simply walk from point A to point B.

However, having all information ever at your fingertips **+** the inherent shame of scrolling mindlessly through social media **+** the infinite amount of things to do and people to talk to in the modern digital era have calcified into a boulder the size of a person, and it makes getting through a single piece of content quite tiring.

On a flat plane, a viewer can get from point A to Point B, but they have to really want to, and they’re likely to want to give up several times.

**So when we script for a medium as ephemeral as short form content, we need to** minimize every little bit of friction that forces the viewer to notice how heavy the boulder is. If at any point they’re aware they’re actively pushing—if your video has a dull moment, too much fluff, or confusing language—suddenly that once “passive” viewer becomes painfully aware of the effort. And once they feel the weight, they’re far more likely to stop altogether.

One of the most crucial techniques is to keep the journey **smooth**. In practical terms, that means:

1.	**Clarity Above All**

Confusion is the steepest hill you can force your viewer to climb. Be concise and direct, so they don’t pause to figure out your point.

2.	**Regular “Mini-Payoffs”**

Show or tell them something interesting frequently. Every new insight or moment of entertainment is like flattening the road beneath them—keeping that boulder rolling without feeling like work.

3.	**Immediate Hook + Rehooks**

If you haven’t grabbed them in the first couple of seconds, they won’t even start pushing. Then, every few lines, rehook them so they barely notice the ongoing journey.

4.	**Avoid Over-Explaining**

Overly dense details act like little stones scattered on the road. If you’re describing something complicated, break it up or simplify it so it doesn’t make the boulder suddenly double in weight.

5.	**Visual or Emotional Beats**

We’re naturally drawn to images and feelings. If you can get them to *feel* something (curiosity, surprise, empathy, humor), it’s as if you’ve momentarily lifted the boulder for them.

**Variances in audience motivation** to push the boulder can be seen as analogous to variances in audience interests that decide whether they push through the less ‘intriguing’ sections of your video. Some people really want to see the end—maybe they love your topic, or they’re loyal fans. Others are just mildly curious and need constant dopamine hits to keep them going. Either way, it’s your job to ensure the path isn’t so steep that they give up prematurely.

**Ultimately**, your script should act like a gentle downhill slope. If you do it right, the viewer never feels the heaviness at all; they just coast along. The second the slope tilts upward—maybe you meander into an irrelevant tangent, or you’re using language that’s too dense—they realize they’re pushing a giant rock. And once they realize it, they’re gone.

That’s our role as creators: **keep them in that passive state as long as possible** by making it easy, breezy, and rewarding. On the blackboard (or whatever visual you’re using), you can literally draw that slope—show the start, the finish, and highlight where the friction points might be. Then, each friction point can be labeled: “too much fluff,” “boring tangent,” “complex jargon,” “salesy CTA,” and so on. Anywhere you add friction, viewers risk becoming *active* and dropping out.

If you can consistently remove those bumps in the road, the viewer will roll that boulder straight to the end without a second thought. And that’s when you’ve succeeded—when completing your video feels like zero effort at all.
