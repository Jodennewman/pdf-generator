## The 3 Cardinal Sins

Ok so cardinal sins - what do I actually mean by this? Well, the cardinal sins are basically the three most common problems, or sins, that I see creators making on short form time and time again, especially those who are new to the platform. If someone’s videos are all stuck on a few hundred views, 99% of the time the cardinal sins are to blame. No you haven’t been shadow banned, you’re either (at best) just inadvertently doing one of these cardinal sins, or at worst, doing some ungodly combination of all three. 

So what are they? 

### The first cardinal sin of short form content, is being boring.

Short-form platforms are at their core, entertianment platforms. People are there almost exclusively to realx, switch off and enjoy themselves. So you chatting about your small business sales revenue, is not by itself, exactly prime entertainment. 

Basically no-one is really on there to learn, and **no-one** is on there to be bored. So if your video doesn’t grab attention fast, and keep them entertained, people will scroll away. 

Now this doesn’t mean you can’t talk about boring things. You can literally talk about anything on these platforms, that’s the beauty of them. You just have to make sure you’re making an active effort to frame it in an interesting way. Like people find ways to make finance or business interesting, and get millions of followers off of it. And on the flip side, people find a way to make really interesting topics like film, or TV, incredibly boring. Don’t worry, in the next section I’ll go through how to solve this one. 

### The second cardinal sin of short form content, is being confusing.

Now I see this one time and time again. Just like I said last time, people are on these platforms to switch off, 99% of people on social media are only half-watching. They’re switched off, they’re passive, and they want to keep it that way. So if your video isn’t immediately clear, simple, and understandable from the get go, they will move on. it simply isn’t worth the effort to try and understand your video, when there are millions of other easy ones to focus on. Basically no-one will try and watch anything confusing.

And again, just like with the first cardinal sin, this doesn’t mean you can’t talk about complex things or concepts. You’ve just got to make sure your video’s purpose and value are clear from the first second, so that people stay. Throughout this course I’ll walk you through exactly how to do that through visual hooks, text hooks and scripting. 

### And the third and final cardinal sin of short form content, is being corporate.

People on short form platforms, especially genZ and gen Alpha can smell an “ad” from a mile away. It doesn’t matter if it’s an ad or NOT. If you sound too scripted or salesy, the viewer turn off. Now this is a thing I see time and time again from people new to short form, who’ve never really been in front of a camera before. They tend to act presentery, and perform their videos like an ad even though its not. Now this might be one of the most common of the sins, but luckily, it’s also the easiest to fix. 

So boring, confusing and corporate, the three main reasons your videos are not performing. In the next video, I’ll go through how to fix them. 

## The Three Cardinal Virtues

So we’ve identified your content is probably at least boring, corporate or confusing (but probably all three). Now the cardinal virtues, which are, you guessed it, the antidote to the cardinal sins. let’s get into them. 

### The first cardinal virtue, and the antidote to being boring, is framing.

Just like I mentioned before, you can talk about whatever you want - boring or not - you just have to find a fun way to present it. I like to think of framing as the slice of cheese you put around a pill you feed to the dog. The boring topic is the pill, and the framing is the cheese that makes the dog happy to the point they don’t even realise they’re taking a pill. 

What’s great about framing, is there are infinite ways to do it. There are quizzes, react videos, greenscreens, podcast clips, skits, listicles to just name a few. Honestly just spend 5 minutes on your tiktok feed and you’ll be able to pick out at least 10 ways to frame videos, that you will be able to adapt to frame your content. 
And luckily, it’s all fair game. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel - just find a format people already enjoy, that you could plug your topic into, and you have made something boring, entertaining. 

Later on in this section I’ll go through some specifics of how to find framings that work, and repackage them for your content. 

### The second cardinal virtue, and the antidote to being confusing, is clarity.

Put simply, clarity starts with a great **hook**—your first few seconds should leave no doubt about what your video is about. And there’s loads of ways to do this. One is through a text hook, the words you put on screen, one is through your verbal hook, the words you’re saying, and another way is through visual prompting - so using props, your background, or your editing to give as much context as possible. As a general rule you want to use simple language, simple visuals, and not overwhelm the viewer so noone gets lost. A simple way to look at it is to evaluate the start of your video, consider you’re seeing it for the first time with no context of who you are or what you do. If it doesn’t feel immediately clear what your video is about, it is too confusing. Keep it straightforward. In the next section we’ll go through the basics on how to make a good hook, so your viewers understand what is going on.

### And the third and final cardinal virtue, and antidote to being corporate, is authenticity.

Even if you’re selling. Stop selling. That “presenter voice” your doing needs to go. Relax, take it down a notch and talk like you would to a friend on FaceTime. If you’re not used to doing this on camera and it scares you, don’t worry, there’s plenty of tips to presenting that we’ll go through in the shooting part of the course. But general takeaway is to relax, and stop trying to do too much. Another way to do this is through a natural script, which we’re covering again very soon. Even the best actor in the world, can’t present something that sounds like a linkedin post, in a natural way. But again, we’ll go through ways to write so it sounds like a real person, and not an ad. But overall this ones pretty simple, the beauty of short form is connection between creator, and audience. So if you make sure to be real and authentic, people will pick up on it, and enjoy your content. 

So if your videos are not performing, you’re either being boring - in which case you need to find some fun new framing. Or you’re being confusing, in which case you need to start sorting out your hooks, or you’re being corporate, in which case your presentation and scripting are what you need to work on. Or you’re all three, in which case, thank god you’ve bought this course. We’ll cover all of it.
