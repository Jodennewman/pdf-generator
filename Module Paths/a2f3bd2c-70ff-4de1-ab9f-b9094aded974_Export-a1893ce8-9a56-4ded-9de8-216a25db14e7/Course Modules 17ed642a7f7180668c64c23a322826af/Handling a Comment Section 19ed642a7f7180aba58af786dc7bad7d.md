This section is all about handling the comment section: knowing when to get involved - and when not to, when to filter it and what to say in it. Involvement in the comments is an incredibly undervalued part of short form content strategy, especially for personal branding. But from our work with clients, can make all the difference. 

When it comes to building a *real* community around your content, ignoring the comment section is a *massive* missed opportunity. It’s not just a dumping ground for people’s opinions; it’s literally the heartbeat of your relationship with your audience. So use it wisely. 

I used to think that once I’d published a post or video, my work was done. But I’ve realized that’s a guaranteed way to come across as completel*y* disconnected and miss out on turning people into true fans. 

When someone takes the time to drop a meaningful comment or ask you a question - that is huge. To them it feels like they’ve sent you a DM, and you not replying is a bit like you airing them. A quick reply back can insstantly turn a casual viewer into a loyal fan and follower. 

Honestly I’ve found the people you respond to early on in your content journey will show up time and time again afterwards. They’ll fight for you in aggy comment sections, support every video, and show continuous love. 

All because that small interaction comment to comment humanises you. And makes people realise “Oh, there’s an actual person behind this account” “and they SEE me”.

This is ESPECIALLY important when it comes to founders. If you have actual influence off platform, which a lot of content creators don’t, your comment back will be even more meaningful. And will make you grow even faster. 

It’s also just the perfect antidote to the cardinal sin of being corporate. 

Now don’t worry. You don’t have to respond to every single one. And as your account grows you won’t be able to. But early on, being active is such a necessary part of the strategy. 

Let’s go into a few times when you definitely should hop in, and what to say. 

The first, ishandling an angry - or hateful - comment section. 

Negativity *will* pop up, it is inevitable. Ignoring it, doesn’t reflect well on you and could make the hate even louder. Clapping back with something snarky, can make you look childish. From experience, I’ve found that a lighthearted, witty response can completely disarm someone who’s angry at them - and diffuse it completely. Something like ‘hey my grandma reads these’ works perfectly. 

By using humour and responding directly I’ve seen time and time again that you end up actually winning them over — they realise you’re a real person who they’ve just said something horrible to — they back down, they respect you, and they will probbably start defending you in future comment sections. 

Of course, there’s a limit to this. If a comment is *straight-up hateful*, not playful at all, or crosses a line into harassment, you don’t owe them a comedic performance. Blocking or deleting in that scenario isn’t censorship; it’s *basic self-preservation.* You’re allowed to protect your space.

At this point, if frequent horrible things are coming up. You’re also able to filter comments for certain key words so that they don’t keep coming up. 

The next time to jump into a conversation, is when you’ve created a debate or a discussion. Now this is different to hate directed at you. 

For this one, picture your comment section as a gathering at your house.  You’ve invited a bunch of people over to hang out and the conversation has got a little heated. If everyone’s having a respectful, lively debate, you might want to chime in with extra context or an opinion to steer the conversation. Respond to a couple comments with something thoughtful and additive. But don’t get too involved, let them chat amongst themselves. 

But. If it’s realy heated - not every argument is worth your energy. If people are going in circles or the debate’s devolving into name-calling, you’re probably not going to save the day by replying. In fact, you might just add fuel to the fire. Step away if it’s clearly going nowhere - keep your response to one or two comments, and leave it at that. Don’t get dragged into a fight with someone. It’s not worth it. 

The third way to use the comments, is to fill the gaps. 

If you’ve watched the research advanced section, we talk all about the importance of keeping information to ‘just the fun bits’ which often means your video will be missing some crucial context or information. 

People will - obviously - tell you this in the comments. And it can turn ugly. So a good way to show that you’re not stupid - you did it intentionaly - is to throw in a comment yourself, or reply to another one. Just clearing up that you left it out for brevity. 

The same applies for if you made a mistake. Just leave one comment, or reply to one, acknolweging it, ‘whoops, will chat to my editors about this one’ or ‘sorry pronounced that name wrong, long filming day 😅’. No need to defend yourself too much, just something to diffuse EVERYONE jumping in to tell you how wrong you are. 

You’ll also find that people *love* a little behind-the-scenes or “here’s the extra info I promised.” If you’ve left out some info, clickbaited a little in the hook. Then writing out a comment that answers can make the comenters feel like they’re getting something *exclusive.* They feel rewarded, plus, it can spark a bunch of follow-up questions or discussions—great for engagement.

Your comment section is *so* much more than random text under your video. It’s a direct line to the people who genuinely care about (or are curious about) what you’re doing. Responding—and responding *thoughtfully*—can transform even the most hateful viewers into supporters. 

By being present, setting healthy limits, and turning your comments into real conversations, you build a community that’s actually *invested* in you and your brand.

**Post it, then own it.** Because the difference between a hollow view count and a thriving fanbase can be as simple as how you handle your comment section.
