# Script

**intro** 

Stranger to customer = funnel

Lead magnet = gravity

website, stories great way to get people off platform

but no one clicks them without a lead mag

If turning a stranger into a customer is all about your funnel, lead magnets are the gravity that pulls people through it. 

Tools like Linktree, many chat and your website are a great way to get your audience to different parts of your ecosystem, but links don’t get tapped unless your audience has a reason to click them.

A lead magnet is a tool to incentivise your audience to take the next step in the relationship. Your content builds trust, authority, and the lead magnet is there to initiate reciprocity.

So, with that in mind, **what makes a GOOD lead magnet?**

A good lead magnet looks like a valuable, unmissable piece of content that the audience gets for free, in return for signing up to your email list.

A lead magnet, can come in many forms, namely:

- checklist
- cheat sheet
- templates
- Masterclasses
- Tutorials
- Infographics
- surveys

In fact, if your seeing this, you’ve probably had a look at ours. And if you tend to give your email out on the internet a lot, youve probably seen many more.

The idea of a lead magnet is to entice a potential customer down the funnel. So they are, by nature, a highly valuable piece of content, that youd sign up to something for.

Some classic uses of lead magnets include, getting followers onto your newsletter, encouraging subscribers to go to a new platform, or simply adding them to a waiting list.

**What lead magnet should I create?**

To understand what lead magnet you should create, you need to do one thing:

1. Build something your audience really wants

If you already have a running business, this should be easy!

Take your core product, and think of the problem that it solves. Now think of a pain that is adjacent to that problem.

For example, we sell courses on how to build your following on the internet. So lead magnets about camera positioning, hook writing, or personal branding would work great, as they solve genuine issues our audience are facing.

If you don’t have a core product yet, don’t worry, think about it from the bottom up:

1. Identify your target audience by listing out your ideal customer’s traits

1. List their pain points, desires and aspirations a really helpful way to do this is with a chatgpt prompt. 

*“My business is targeting keen gardeners who live in the home counties between the ages of 40 & 60, please create a table of their top pain points, desires and aspirations I can solve as a strawberry growing specialist”*

1. Once you have your audience in mind, and understand their pains, create a lead magnet that resolves those pains.

The strawberry specialist might take his expertise to advise beginner followers on soil health. Now doesnt that sound valuable.

**Getting technical**

So, your lead magnet is the best representation of your company to your potential customer.

Therefore it needs to be well designed, with a clear structure, heading, subheadings, mobile friendly design (as thats where they’ll consume it) and an over delivery of value.

Tools to create a brilliant lead magnet:

- Canva
- Typeform
- Youtube (private video)

We’ve included a run through of how to use canva as your main port of call for lead magnets - but the fundamentals are simple.

Make it on brand

And PACK it full of information.

The smaller the text, the better. Go for detail, and please dont gate keep. Again, this is about demonstrating your value to customers, so that they trust you enough to buy in the future.

**Promoting your lead magnet & using MANYCHAT**

Once you’ve used these tools to create a strong lead magnet, you’re going to need to distribute it.

We recommend using MANYCHAT for Meta platforms and linktree (link in bio) for the rest.

Above all, your linktree should contain only essential links:

- Link to your lead magnet
- Link to your product
- Links to socials/website

Too many links are confusing and many businesses opt for no linktree, and just a link to their lead magnet. This can be a good strategy, but remember people will be hitting your link for context about you, so thats why we’d recommend including other socials & your website.

Regardless of whether you use manychat, put the linktree link in all of your socials bios, so you know your followers are being directed to the right places, even if they’re just snooping.

Then, you can move on to refining your manychat strategy. 

Manychat is a service that allows your link to be sent directly to the person if they comment a particular word or phrase.

Many chat is a god send for several reasons:

1. it incentivises engagement
2. it looks cool
3. it makes the signup journey extremely easy for the user.

Whilst many chat only works on Meta platforms, it is extremely effective.

You want the phrase to be something you can plan a CTA around. So in our strawberry specialists videos he might say 

“by the way, if you want to know more about soil, comment GROW”

And manychat would send appropriate commenters the lead magnet.

However, whilst the “comment a phrase” method drives engagement, you need to proceed with caution.

The conversation in comment sections is part of a healthy engaging video. If people go into the comments and only see people commenting the same word with no discussion, it looks bad. Like overwatering a plant. 

Get around this by getting users to DM you instead OR by reworking your CTA to incentivise thoughtful comments with the key word included. 

Regardless of whether your promoting a lead magnet, content should always aim to make discussion, so make sure you dont leave that objective out

Whichever way you go, ManyChat will automatically DM someone a link to download your Lead Magnet – which means it is less intrusive (they can continue scrolling and come back later), and it feels personal (even if it is a bot.

**Life after leads**

Ultimately, once you nail your first lead magnet, the fun really starts. you can use a series of lead magnets at different points to target different segments of your audience. You can track what lead magnet has gained the most attention to give you better insights of what your audience wants

So, once your lead magnet strategy has been setup and implemented, you will have a strong system of incentives that pull your audience further down the funnel.

FUNNEL PDF

- What is a Lead Magnet
- What is a good lead magnet to the scrolling audience
- Link in Bio, Link trees, Links on stories, Manychat automations
- The less obstruction to someone’s scroll, the more likely they will go through with the lead magnet.
- Manychat automation’s ‘comment KEYWORD’ is best here. Although as discussed, the conversation in comment sections is part of a healthy engaging video. If people go into the comments and only see people commenting the same word with no discussion, it looks bad. Like overwatering a plant. Get around this by using the DM function, OR by reworking your CTA to get someone’s comment to include the key word, or make sure your video is constructed in other ways to create discussion. Whichever way you go, ManyChat will automatically DM someone a link to download your Lead Magnet – which means it is less intrusive (they can continue scrolling and come back later), and it feels personal (even if it is a bot. This only works on the meta platforms, and does not have TikTok support – but it is something you could pay a VA to do (take precaution not to seem like a bot, otherwise expect suppression) – that’s down to the ROI.
- Stories is a good one as it gets viewers to engage with your page in a deeper way than just ‘link in bio’. Plus they can see a little bit more promotional material before clicking through to the app.

Also Josh sent me this a while back to help with the masterclass- maybe some extra value from this (as long as nothing conflicts with anything we say)
