Ok so this module is all about repurposing content. So you’ve seen a short form video, or a youtube video, or an article, that you want to make your own video about. How do you it?

Well we’ve already established that pre-validation is KEY. But that doesn’t mean copying or stealing. Which is why this will focus on how to **repurpose and adap**t the inspiration, so that it works for YOUR short form channel. 

But isn’t doing a video on the same topics stealing? Well think about it. Every major newspaper writes about exactly the same stories, so there is innate similarity in a lot of their content. Some days the headlines are almost exactly the same. But the reason it doesn’t come across as stolen is because the tone is different, the angle is different, or there’s some extra information in one not the other. They all copy each other, because they adapt it enough to be unique. That is the key to repurposing short form content. You want to be the BBC, to someone else’s guardian.

Now a lot of this process is very similar to the ‘active’ mindset I talked about in the research section. As that is a key part of repurposing. But on this we’ll focus more on how to turn that research, and those nights from that active way of thinking, into a new script.

**Repurposing a short form video** 

First up, we’ll go through repurposing another short form video. You’ve been scrolling through your feed, found something viral, in your niche, and you want it for yourself. Now stealing word for word is bad practice. It’s not illegal, but, it’s just not the way to play the game. Let’s go through how to ‘take inspiration’ without just directly ripping. 

So starting off with the hook. in general you do’t want to change this too much, as this is often the reason for the virality. So here’s a couple tips for rewriting. 
First, ask yourself what message, what questions are they asking in their hook. Can you ask the same question in different words? Can it be rewritten as a statement that still prompts the same questions? 

If not, that’s ok, the next thing to look at is the comment section. Are there any comments with tens of thousands of likes? Could one of those comments work in its place as a hook for a video? 

Again not always. In which case, are there any synonyms for the words they used in their hook, that would fit your video better - any ways to reword to your tone?
And if no to all of those. Then ok. Sometimes rewriting a hook means the video just won’t hit the same, and so you have to just directly take it. Now that’s ok, but you have to make sure the visual hook (what’s on screen) is different enough, and of course, change the rest of the script. 

Ok so to repurpose the script. Now a lot of you will just think to run it through ChatGPT and ask it to rewrite it. My advice, is don’t do that. It will ‘rewrite’ the words, i.e., just come up with new synonyms for them, but will barely change it enough, and will likely take the personality out - and just generally flatten it. instead, try and work out what you find funny about it, that active thinking we were talking about in research. What do you find interesting about it, where did you laugh, what thoughts did you have, what would you add to it, what do you think they’re missing. Start with those questions, and see how much you can change it. Then when it comes to rewriting, even if the video is great, can you make it even better? The answer is, probably. There’s always some fluff you can remove, some unnecessary tangent that you don’t have to go on, that could make your video perform even better. 

It’s also great to read the comments on the video you’re taking here, as they often add something extra about **why** people reacted to the video - in the comments you can usually tell what people liked, and didn’t like about it. If you can address these, to add something extra. Then great. Again, similar to hooks, if someones made a good joke, or a good observation. Just add it into your script. 

But if you get to the end, and it still seems **very** similar. But its the best rewrite you can do, then just make sure on the other side of the process, you change up the text hook, the delivery, and the format of visuals so that it matches your style. And if you feel like that’s not enough, it’s always worth tagging the original creator of the video in your caption to thank them. 

**Repurposing a long form video** 

Ok next, repurposing long form. You’ll be glad to hear this is much easier than short form. It’s always easier to distill something really long, into something really short. Most youtube videos you could probably get a good 5 or 6 TikToks out of. So keep that in mind too. If you love the video, and there’s loads of valuable points, don’t try and cram it all in there. 

First I’ll go through how to make one short form video, out of one long form. Again, we’re starting with the active research. I’d recommend watching the video, on 2 times speed of course, not making any notes, unless there’s a really interesting fact or statistic you need to write down to remember the specifics of - and then writing a short form video off of the general sentiment you remember from the video. 
This approach works because you’re taking out what’s actually interesting. What the main beats of the story are. And again, this is short form, so no-one wants their time wasted. This process will cut through that completely - and filters out what is most affective, and most memorable. 

Then, if you want to repurpose a long form video into multiple video - i’d suggest a slightly different approach. Sit and go through the video (probably NOT at 2 times speed) and mark out every point you love. At this point, pause the video and write a short summary of what was said, and save it as an idea to come back to later. Do this for the full video. 
Then come back to your notes. At this point, their wording, isn’t in your head anymore - just your summary and notes. Then use this as a basis for your own video, do the necessary research and stats yourself. Then when you’ve finished your mini scripts, go back to the Youtube again. It’s surprising how often you accidentally recreate the same exact script, as their wording is still somewhere in your memory, so worth doubling checking this hasn’t happened - and if it has - just make the necessary changes.  

**Repurposing an article** 

Ok so repurposing articles. A good way to look at this, is the compare the article, to a short form video. The headline is the hook - just like we talked about in the short form script, see how you can reword that. And the article body itself is the script. Luckily with an article, this is again very easy to distill. There is always a lot of fluff to be removed. 
What you have to be careful about, is the wording. So when I started this job i came from newsletter copywriting meaning I was used to that ‘journalistic style’. On short form videos, writing your script in that way sounds, bad - and leads into that ‘cardinal sin’. So make  sure to remove any of that ‘copy’ element when refactoring it, and just write it again, how you’d actually say it. 

**Takeaway** 

Over time developing that eye for what is *actually interesting* about another piece of media will come. In the short term it might be difficult, but just try and analyse what you like about it, what made your ears prick up, what made you laugh, what made you want to copy it - then double down on that and make sure to inject a little of yourself into it. 

And as a general rule of thumb. Hooks, formats, and topics are fair game. Scripts - can follow a similar structure but HAVE to be reworded to your voice, and ideally will have the structure changed too. And copying someone else’s hook, format AND topic, is a little risky, and probably better to see if there’s a way to do it a little different.
