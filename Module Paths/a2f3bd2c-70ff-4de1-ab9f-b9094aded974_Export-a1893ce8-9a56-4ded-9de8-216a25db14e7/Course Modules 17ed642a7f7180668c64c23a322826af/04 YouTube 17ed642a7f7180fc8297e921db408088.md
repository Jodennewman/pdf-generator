# Script

Youtube is one of the safest platforms on the internet for brands. There is no question mark over its future and it has now built a history of supporting long term careers for creators globally.

So if you’re looking to build community, Youtube can deepen that relationship and turn short form followers into connected fans. 

But depsite it looking like a slightly more in depth Tiktok, don’t be fooled. Youtube is its own beast and whilst it can go hand in hand with your short form strategy, you need to follow its rules to build an audience there. 

Here’s how Youtube differs from short form, so you can start prepared

1. firstly Views are way more real

Youtube is a platform saturated with brilliant creators and longer form videos, meaning the competition for attention is serious. 

1. Production value is higher

With the Sidemen bringing in more viewers than the Premiere League, this is a space where you can make a dent as a proper, polished brand. But also, your competing against the best

1. Progress is slow, but the community is brilliant

Youtube is a long game, that pays off exponentially if you stick with it.

There are several ways your short form strategy should inform what you do on Youtube:

Look at what has been the most popular with your audience on short form.

Content that you create for Youtube should stand on the pillars you built for short form. 

But be careful, the formats should stay the same, but the buckets can’t.

Stuff that works in a 1 minute video is not likely to translate to a 15 minute video.

Analyse what has worked on short form, and spend time thinking about what the audience youve captured there could get from a longer video. 

Research similar channels in your niche and from there you will get an idea of how to translate your short form approach into long form buckets.

Remember, same pillars, different buckets.

Youtube videos live or die by retention. So whether your trying to gain an audience in platform or send people to your video via others, the content needs to be a massive value add for your current community, otherwise they wont choose to stick around after following you, tanking your view to subscriber stats, and downranking you in the algorithm.

1. Secondly, Remember, Shorts subscribers don’t necessarily translate into long-form viewers, but you absolutely should be using the platform because the growth can be monumental. Treat Shorts more like previews for your main channel.

Creating brilliant previews comes before you make the full video, not in the edit after, and its really worth thinking about how you structure your videos to clip for short form.

Several creators do just this, using their Youtube videos as a polished version of a batch to pull vertical videos from.

The rules remain the same if you do this, make sure your creating scripts and visuals that hook the viewer and make sense by themselves, whilst working in a wider Youtube video’s context

1. Third, It’s tempting to push your YouTube link everywhere when you launch, but if people click in and bounce right out, YouTube’s algorithm notices. Quality watch time is more important than a flood of short-lived clicks, so make sure the video you lead with is very interesting to your current base. Again, think of it like a lead magnet, give unbelievable value.

1. Fourth, With longer videos, you need to think harder about giving people reasons to stick around. always think about rehooking your audience to keep them watching.

1. Fifth, Don’t sleep on the Community tab. It’s a simple way to post polls, images, or text updates. It also gives subscribers a reason to check in on your channel between uploads.

Ultimately, remember long form content is here to help you build a stronger relationship with your audience, where the more time you spend with them the more trust you build.

A lot of short form creators decide to evolve onto Youtube. As a short from creator, you already have a lot of the knowledge, skills and pipeline you need to succeed with longer form, so it can be a logical next step.

Youtube is one of the safest platforms on the internet for brands. Unlike Tiktok, there is no question mark over its future and it has now built a history of supporting long term careers for creators globally.

So Youtube could be a fantastic move to deepen that relationship. But depsite it looking like a slightly more in depth Tiktok, don’t be fooled. Youtube is its own beast and you need to follow its rules to build an audience there. 

Here are some harsh truths you need to know before starting:

1. Views are way more real

Youtube is a platform saturated with brilliant creators and longer form videos, meaning the competition for attention is serious. 

1. Production value is higher

Top Youtubers are bringing in more views than primetime BBC. This is a space where you can make a dent as a proper, polished brand.

1. Progress is slow, but the community is brilliant

Youtube is a long game, that pays off exponentially if you stick with it.

The methods we’ve taught you about short form were originally learnt from youtube. With a more professional creator type to compete against, you need to nail the fundamentals and follow these steps to start a channel:

---

---

### 1. Decide your focus

You have nailed your niche on short form, so think about how you can add value your existing follower. EXAMPLE

---

### 2. Plan Your Setup

Quality is more important on youtube

---

### 3. Pillars, buckets, formats

make sure you know your pillars buckets and formats. But its even MORE important this time because your trying to sustain attention throuh 15 mionutes not 45 seconds,. 

---

### 4. Scripting

so therefore scripting is incredibly important.m Write out your main points and think about where you can re-hook viewers.

---

### 5. Posting & Scheduling

YouTube rewards consistency.

---

### 6. Sustaining Momentum

Keep an eye on analytics: watch time, audience retention, click-through rates from thumbnails. If you see viewers dropping off at the same point in each video, figure out why—maybe it’s the way you’re transitioning between segments, or maybe it’s too long before you get to the interesting stuff. Also, consider directing viewers to your other platforms or products—if that fits your goals.

## Critical Adjustments for YouTube

1. **Shorts vs. Long-Form**
    
    You can still post YouTube Shorts—especially if you’re repurposing what you’ve done on TikTok or Reels—but remember, Shorts subscribers don’t necessarily translate into long-form viewers. Treat Shorts more like previews for your main channel.
    
2. **External Traffic**
    
    It’s tempting to push your YouTube link everywhere, but if people click in and bounce right out, YouTube’s algorithm notices. Quality watch time is more important than a flood of short-lived clicks.
    
3. **Pacing and Retention**
    
    Even though your video is longer, you still need to give people reasons to stick around. A quick one-liner that hints at something exciting coming up can keep them watching.
    
4. **Community Engagement**
    
    Don’t sleep on the Community tab. It’s a simple way to post polls, images, or text updates. It also gives subscribers a reason to check in on your channel between uploads.

## Before You Get Started

- **Mental Prep**: Growing on YouTube can be slower than on short-form apps. Be patient.
- **Equipment**: A decent mic and some basic lighting go a long way.
- **Batch Filming**: If your schedule is hectic, consider filming multiple videos at once. Change up your shirt or background if you don’t want it to look like one big recording session.

---

## Sample Action Steps

1. **Pick Your First 3 Topics**Align them with your short-form pillars so your brand stays consistent.
2. **Plan Your Format**Are you doing a talking-head piece, a vlog, or a reaction video? Map out your intro, main points, and conclusion.
3. **Record and Edit**Focus on good lighting and decent sound. Keep the story clear and try not to ramble.
4. **Upload and Assess**Check how long people are watching. Are they dropping off early? Figure out why.
5. **Promote Selectively**Post a teaser on TikTok or Reels if you want—but make sure it’s compelling enough to attract viewers who actually want to watch the full video.
