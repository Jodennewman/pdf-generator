As much as I’d like to be able to tell you that there’s a neat trick with a 100% success rate for getting incredible new clients or finding work that satisfies every creative desire you have. That just wouldn’t be entirely true.

What IS true though, is that there are proven ways for you to grow your network and then convert that network in to tangible work, projects and commisions, through your personal brand.

Clients we work with mix traditional sales methods with the outsized advantage content gives you to create a never ending funnel of new clients. Here’s how:

Online:

- Give away your secret sauce. No one will be able to implement it like you, and there are a thousand ways to get it wrong, so dont be afraid of literally just delivering the most value you possibly can. The right audience will find you, trust you and ultimately buy from you.
- Always share your work. A large online following means nothing if they dont know what you can do for them.
- Use the internet to network. Hard. You’ve got to remember, peoples emails, whatsapps and linkedins are full to the brim. So their tiktok inbox, may be the place you catch them. Any excuse, reach out and connect. Don’t be desperate.
- Revise your industry. Learn who the big movers and shakers are and find a good reason to reach out to them.
- To make sure these efforts dont go to waste, ensure your website is modern, up to date, and fully optimised. Run tests.
- use your personal brand to practice what you preach. Become an authority on a topic (the guy who) and become the obvious person to reach out to.

so thats what you can do online. Make sure you supplement this IRL by:

- Touching base with any relationships you form - it is the equivalent of watering your plants. It can be repetitive and boring but you won’t get anywhere without it.
- Get networking in real life. A cold beer will always work over a cold dm.
- Ask for referrals from satisfied clients - people trust people.
- Partner up. Screw being competitive. You will likely have something unique to add to even your closest competitor. Talk, consider, and refer each other.
- And finally, coming back to watering your plants,  follow up consistently with potential clients. Things can change quickly. Don’t be forgotten when they do.

There’s massive upside to networking and building a client base with content. But keep in mind some faux pas you should avoid:

- never ever ever talk about real life situations when theyve just happened. Not for employees, or clients. You don’t want an internet mud slinging match
- Make sure your tone is approachable, you want a considered, smart voice, but no one likes a know it all.
