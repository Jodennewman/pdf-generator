So if you’ve followed through with the workshops, and all of the theory so far. You should be at a place where you’ve developed a ready to go beginner strategy, you’ve got a few buckets you’re excited about - and it’s time to start posting. Great.

Then let’s say 3 weeks in, you’ve posted 10 videos and they’ve all flopped some are stuck in 200 view jail, others are around the 1000 mark, and they’re just not hitting how you expected - what do you do? Do you keep going with the ideas? Or do you give up?

That’s exactly what we’re going to answer in this section.

Before we get into it, if you are in this position, where nothing’s quite hitting how you want. I understand it’s demoralising, but it is very normal and honestly just part of the game. I actually think it’s almost a rule that the ideas you’re MOST excited about and want to do really well – are often the ones that fail the most.

As much as we’ve been able to crack social media, sometimes you just don’t get it right and you don’t understand why - until you look at the data. The metric analysis and readings that can help us identify how to make it better.

In this section, we’ll first look at what you can learn from: retention and comments - the two most important metrics in the iteration process as they say the MOST about your viewer behaviour. We’ll then take a brief look at what we can learn from all the other metrics, before using them to decide whether to keep going, or give up entirely.

The reason i advocate for posting consistently, every single day if possible, is you can collect SO much data on your content and your viewers to learn from. Flops are inevitable. And the accounts that continue to struggle are the ones that don’t try and learn from the mistakes, don’t try and see what they can change to improve it.

Ok. Let’s start with retention. The graph of how long people in general stick with your video. And where they tend to leave. This will tell you a lot about where you’re going wrong, and what to fix first. 

All retention graphs have a drop off. I don’t think anyone, ever, has made a video where everyone who sees it stays until the end. So drop off is normal. 

But if you see big drop **immediately** (like this) [draw on board]. Then the problem isn’t necessarily your idea, but it **is** your hook. Whether visual, verbal , text or a combination of all three. In this case, before giving up on the bucket, try and improve the hook as best you can. Give it at least three more goes, referencing back to the hook sections on the course, and trying to see it through new viewers eyes. Assume you’ve got it wrong, before giving up entirely.

If instead, you see a big retention dip after a few seconds like this - **right after the hook** [draw on board].

Then the problem could be your script, your topic or your format. Start out with a new script, always assume your idea is better than your execution. So give this a couple of tries. If it makes no difference, then maybe switch up the format. But if you’ve had consistently low views even after making some changes. Then it might be time to drop it and move on.

Then if you see a retention drop maybe **during your call-to-action**, or just **towards the end of your video**, [draw on board]. Then the problem definitely isn’t the bucket it’s your script, specifically the end of your script. You are either teeing up that you’re finishing the video, reaching conclusion territory. or you haven’t rehookked enough. If this is the case, stick with your idea, but make sure there’s a compelling payoff that keeps them watching until the last second, and don’t give any sign of wrapping up or concluding.

Just a quick note here, it’s also worth looking at the retention even if your video IS doing well. Because it can always be doing better. Have a look at where you’re losing people and see how you can tweak it to do to even better. Or it does way worse but then you’ve at least learnt something.

The second important metric to look at when deciding how to iterate is comments.

Comments are your best insights into the viewers minds. If there are no comments, you’re not generating conversation. Try and think - what would I comment on this if it came up on my feed, why would anyone comment? If you can’t think of a reason, put this into your script. Either think of little hacks you can put in, or new audiences to target to get that conversation going and people emotionally connecting with your video. Again, try this a few times before giving up entirely. 

Alternatively, if your bucket is flopping on views, but has great comments, **stick with it**. Same for if it gets loads of shares or saves. It has *potential*. Really think about tightening your hook or your script, always reference back to the retention to see which one is probably the issue, and try it out as much as possible.

Another thing to look at in your comments when determinng whether to give up or keep going, is WHAT people are saying. Often you can use this to see whether the topic is interesting, and what people actually care and enjoy within the bucekt or the execution. Always listen to what people are telling you.

So retention and comments are the best places to work out people’s sentiment. 

But followers, shares, and saves are also good to look at, to show what people find valuable about it.

If the video has high follower conversion, it means it’s building fans. Even if the views aren’t high, this is incredibly valuable, and means you’re reaching your niche communty. Stick with this one. 

If the video has high shares, it means you’re tapping into a conversation that communities and groups of friends are having off platform. Double down on this. The topic is definitely great, maybe its just the format that needs improving. 

And if you have high saves, it means you’re making HIGH value content. Try and work out how to make it more entertaining through a different format so you can boost your views. But stick with the topic. 

Look at all of these factors. Then iterate, iterate, and if no improvement, eliminate.

This part of the iteration process, isn’t always just for inital strategy to. This can happen months or weeks in. 

A bucket can be doing incredibly well for months and then start slowing. Because sometimes people just get bored. It’s ok to drop it for a bit, try something new, and maybe come back to it later. Short form platforms are not consistent. And buckets aren’t always evergreen. Just look at the data to work out what’s going on. 

If audience’s tastes change, and these can change quickly, don’t be afraid to pivot from a bucket that was great. Or to double down when a bucket finally starts working.

So to conclude, an impressive, converting, and growing short form strategy all comes from data-led iteration. First port of call is ALWAYS to blame your execution, as that is (from my experience) where its normally going wrong. Your idea is only as good as you make it. This is very often the bottle neck.

People literally talk about anything on these platforms and they do well, because they’re engaging and done well.

Look at what the numbers are telling you, and do the best job you can to take it on board, take the ego hit, and make the video better for next time. Just keep consistenly posting, and learning from every single video. 

And if you’ve hit 200 views on the same video three times? Scrap it.

    Below is the same text with minimal repetition removed and slightly tightened paragraphs. *No wording has been changed*—only one brief line has been lifted out (the duplicate mention of “Specifically we’re going to learn how to use the data…”) to avoid repeating the same point. Everything else is intact, just re-paragraphed or joined up for smoother flow.
    
    So if you’ve followed through with the workshops, and all of the theory so far. You should be at a place where you’ve developed a ready to go beginner strategy, you’ve got a few buckets you’re excited about - and it’s time to start posting. Great 
    
    Then let’s say in 3 weeks, you’ve posted 10 videos and they’ve all flopped. They’re all in 200 view jail and it’s not hitting how you expected - what do you do? Do you stick around? Or do you give up?
    
    That’s exactly what we’re going to answer in this section. 
    
    Specifically we’re going to learn how to use the **data** from the flops, to help guide your strategy. How to learn from your mistakes. 
    
    First if you are in this position, where nothing’s quite hitting how you want. I understand it’s demoralising, but it’s also very normal and frankly just part of the game. As much as we’ve been able to crack social media, sometimes you just don’t get it right and you don’t understand why. 
    
    I think it’s almost a rule that the ideas you’re MOST excited about and want to do really well – are often the ones that fail the most. 
    
    But the benefits of this all lies in the data. In the metric analysis and readings. That help us identify how to make it better. 
    
    In this section, we’ll first look at what you can learn from: retention and comments - the two most important metrics in the iteration process as they say the MOST about your viewer behaviour. We’ll then take a brief look at what we can learn from all the other metrics, before using them to decide whether to keep going, or give up entirely. 
    
    The reason i advocate for posting consistently, every single day if possible, is you can collect so much data on your content and your viewers to learn from. Flops are inevitable. And the accounts that continue to struggle are the ones that don’t try and learn from the mistakes, don’t try and see what they can change to improve it.  
    
    It’s always worth iterating a few times on the idea, and assuming your execution is the problem, than giving up on the bucket entirely.
    
    Let’s start with retention. The graph of how long people in general stick with your video. And where they tend to leave. This will tell you a lot about where you’re going wrong. 
    
    All retention graphs have a drop off.

    If instead, you see a big retention dip after a few seconds like this - right after the hook ****[draw on board]. 
    
    Then the problem is less easy to identify. It could be your script, your topic or your format. Start out with a new script, always assume your idea is better than your execution. So give this a couple of tries. If it makes no difference, then maybe switch up the format. But if you’ve had consistently low views even after making some changes. Then it might be time to drop it and move on.
    
    Then if you see a retention drop maying during your call-to-action, or just towards the end of your video, then the problem definitely isn’t the bucket it’s your script. You are either teeing up that you’re finishing the video, reaching conclusion territory. or you haven’t rehookked enough. If this is the case, stick with your idea, but make sure there’s a compelling payoff that keeps them watching until the last second, and don’t give any sign of wrapping up or concluding.

    Another great thing to look at is comments. 
    
    Comments are your best insights into the viewers minds. If there are no comments, you’re not generating conversation. 
    Try and think - what would I ocmment on this if it came up on my feed, why would anyone comment? If you can’t think of a reason, it’s probably not the idea, it’s your exectuion. So think of little hacks you can put in, or new audiences to target to get that conversation going and people emotionally connecting with your video. Try this a few times before giving p. 
    
    Then if a bucket is flopping, but has great comments, stick with it. Same for if it gets loads of shares or saves. It has *potential*. Really think about tightening your hook or your script, always reference back to the retentino to see which is probably the issue, and try it out as much as possible. 
    
    Another thing to look at in your comments when determinng whether to give up or keep going, is WHAT people are saying. Often you can use this to see whether the topic is interesting, and what people actually care about within the topic. To see if its worth sticking with. Always listen to what people are telling you. 
    
    So retention and comments are the best places to work out people’s sentiment. But followers, shares, and saves are also good to look at, to show what people find valuable about it. 
    
    So look at all of these factors. Then iterate, iterate, and if no improvement, eliminate. 
    
    I’d say each new bucket is worth trying a few times. At least 3 more attempts - as long as you’re making active changes to improve things. If you don’t see noticeable growth from any of them eliminate. 
    
    Same goes for a bucket that does amazingly well initially, and then starts slowing. Sometimes people just get bored. It’s ok to drop it for a bit, try something new, and maybe come back to it later. Short form platforms are not consistent. And buckets aren’t always evergreen.
    
    If audience’s tastes change, and these can change quickly, don’t be afraid to pivot from a bucket that was great. Or to double down when a bucket finally starts working. 
    
     
    
    So to conclude, an impressive, converting, and growing short form straetgy all comes from data-led iteration. First port of call is ALWAYS to blame your execution, as that is (from my experience) where its normally going wrong. Your idea is only as good as you make it. This is very often the bottle neck. 
    
    Look at what the numbers are telling you, and do the best job you can to take it on board, take the ego hit, and make the video better for next time. 
    
    And if you’ve hit 200 views on the same video three times? Scrap it. 
    
    People literally talk about anything on these platforms and they do well, because they’re engaging and done well.
    
    So keep trying, keep consistently posting, and if you’re concentrating on the data you will work out what people like and want from you - and have a content engine that largely runs itself. 
    
    And with all strategy. The beginning is the hardest. It will get easier. Eventually your audience will get bored and you’ll have to pivot again, but at that time it’ll be easier than when you’ve started because you’ll have more understanding of the platform and your audience. Just follow these rules, and constantly check back in that your content fits the ratio, the metrics, and the right structures — and you will be able to consistently grow with it. Trust me we’ve done this hundreds of times.

    **Putting It Into Practice: Mini-Exercise**
    
    1.	**List 3 Pillars:**
    
    •	Brainstorm three areas you’re passionate about and want to be known for.
    
    2.	**Create 5 Topics Under Each Pillar:**
    
    •	For example, if a pillar is “Workplace Culture,” your topics might be: “Dealing with Burnout,” “Toxic Boss Warnings,” “Hybrid Work Hacks,” “Office Politics,” and “Team-Building Tips.”
    
    3.	**Design 3 Buckets:**
    
    •	Pick a format (React, Listicle, Storytime, etc.) + pick a topic from your list + attach the relevant pillar.
    
    4.	**Analyze & Adjust:**
    
    •	Post your videos, then look at watch-time and new followers.
    
    •	Tweak your next batch based on retention data and conversion rates.
    
    **Key Reminder:** You don’t need a million ideas. You need **a few repeatable buckets** that your audience starts to *recognize and love*.
    
    **Final Word**
    
    By combining **pillars** (your big themes), **topics** (focused angles), and **buckets** (repeatable formats), you’ll build a solid short-form foundation. Then, by studying **retention graphs, conversion metrics**, and balancing **broad vs. focused** topics, you’ll refine your content into a lean, mean, audience-growing machine.
    
    Short-form success isn’t just about going viral—it’s about **consistency**, **recognition**, and **continuous improvement**. Use this data-led approach, and you’ll create videos that hook viewers, earn follows, and establish a personal brand that stands out in any crowded feed.
    
- Old Script
    
    So in this section we’re gonna talk about data led strategy. An in depth look into how to build the perfect short form strategy — covering pillars, topics, and buckets — step by step — that will convert into sales, new business or speaking engagements. Then we’ll show you how to refine and perfect it using retention graphs, conversion metrics, and a smart ratio of broad vs focused content. 
    
    The key to perfecting short form strategy for your personal brand, or your business, is what you want to talk about , with what your audience wants. And specifically how to do this through the data.  
    
    First, let’s talk how to build a strategy off what you want to say and how you want to come across. And the way to build this, is to first define your Pillars, then break these down into topics, and finally end up with video buckets. 
    
    Don’t worry, it’s easier than it sounds. 
    
    Let’s start with pillars. 
    
    So pillars are your big-picture themes - the core ideas or areas of expertise you want to be known for. If you’re a fitness coach your pillars might be “Sustainable Nutrition,” “Gym-Appropriate Fashion,” and “Mindset & Motivation.” If you’re an entreprenuer these could be “Startup Growth,” “Leadership” and “Investment”
    
    Pillars are the best place to start as they’re the bedrock of your content. Having clearly defined pillars will make your content consistent, focussed, and will help new viewers understand who you are, what you stand for, and why they should follow you. Good defined pillars are core to building a community.
    
    So how do you come up with them? 
    
    Well if you have the beginnings of a personal brand, be that a presence on linkedin, or just in network. You might already have these. Or you might be completely new to this and have never actually written them down.
    
    Either way, I want you to sit down with a pen and paper and ask yourself these 5 questions:
    
    1. What are the main themes I care about?
    2. What are the main themes I want to be known for? 
    
    3. Do these themes have enough depth that I can talk about them for month, without running out of ideas? 
    
    4. Are other people interested in these themes too? Then, this is especially important for short form, are young people interested in these themes? And if not, can you tweak it so they are? 
    
    1. And finally, are **enough** people interested in these themes, that there’s an audience? 
    
    Don’t worry if your pillars are different form each other, you can talk about both pop culture and business — there’s no reason for them all to be cohesive. Just make sure they’re genuine and answer those questions above. 
    
    After this process you may have around 10 pillars. This is way too many, so whittle down these main themes until you have around 3 distinct pillars that you can talk about forever, and other people will listen to forever. Then you’re good to go. 
    
    Now you’ve got your pillars. It’s break those pillars into topics. 
    
    So topics are the **focused subjects** that live under each pillar. For example, if a pillar is “Healthy Workplace Culture,” you might have topics like:
    
    •	Toxic Boss Encounters
    
    •	Remote Work Boundaries
    
    •	Burnout Prevention Tools 
    
    •	Corporate Language 
    
    Good topics are important as they give you a structured way to come up with new content ideas easily. And they make your short form varied but cohesive. 
    
    To come up with topics that will do well on short form, just think about different ways that your pillar will affect people. Brainstorm common problems, dilemmas, questions, stresses or interests people could have within each pillar. That you can talk about - either by highlighting the problem, or giving a solution. 
    
    For example, if one of your pillars is “financial advice”. Young people aren’t necessarily interested in all the topics within that. It’s not a big emotional point for them. But what is emotional, and important to them, is making money, so your topics could be ‘businesses to start that don’t need investment’, ‘how to invest earning less than 35k’, ‘side hustles that ACTUALLY make money’,  whatever. Just make sure your topics speak to the audience and their problems. 
    
    For example, one of your topics could be good management. Young people might not be into “learning how to be a great manager,” but they are interested in how to **recognise and avoid terrible managers**. When coming up with your topics get creative so that your topics are still your core messaging, but will resonate more with people on these apps.
    
    If you need help with that, it look what’s trending or frequently discussed among your competitors - the research module will be very helpful with this. 
    Look into subreddits, forums, comment sections to see what topics people are talking about - and want talked about more. 
    
    And just think of personal experience - what can you say that will ADD to the conversation. Or even bring up a new conversation entirely. 
    
    Then just like we did with the pillars. Give yourself 20 minutes to come up with 3 topics within each pillar, that fit criteria. And at the end you’ll have 9 different topics to talk about. 
    
    Then the next part - is making buckets. Buckets are the types of videos, the repeatable formats you see on your page like ‘people reacting to videos of bad bosses’ or ‘making pottery inspired by the zodiac signs’ or ‘five signs your manager doesn’t respect you’. These are what will form the basis of your short form strategy. Here’s how to make them.
    
    So to make a bucket you just combine a topic (like the 9 you just created) with a format Formats we just discussed in the last video. These are your reacts, storytimes, greenscreens, listicles, etcetera. 
    
    So just take one topic. And one of those formats - combine then, and you have a bucket. 
    
    Say you’re trying to promote your banking app business, and one of your topics is ‘saving hacks for families’. Then a bucket could be. 
    
    ‘top 5 ways to cut down your bills’ - combining the topic, with the listicle format 
    
    or ‘comparing average yearly bills 20 years ago vs now’ - combining the ‘comparison format’ with the saving money topic 
    
    OR 
    
    ‘budgeting for ‘X’ salary in central london’ - combining the ‘budgeting format’ with that topic. 
    
    And each of those buckets you can return to frequently, and make a lot of videos out of. 
    
    Like for the comparing average bills bucket - you can do a video comparing bills pre covid and post covid. Then one comparing house prices in the 80, 00s and 20s. You can do one on car prices, looking at insurance car cost, taxes, petrol etc. You can do one on the cost of different basic food items: like milk, bread, flour, meat in the past 10 years. 
    
    You can literally infinitely repeat this bucket, meaning people can KNOW you for it. You’re getting that messaging out there frequently, and your audience will begin to recognise and anticipate those videos from your account. Meaning you’ll build followers and community. 
    
    A bucket based strategy works so well because it’s very optimised for the algorithm. Constantly putting out the same type of video helps the algorithm understand quickly what the video is about and who to send it to. If someone interacts with 2 of the videos in your bucket. The algorithm will send them the rest of the videos that bucket - because it’ll recognise them as similar. So having more videos of the same ‘type’ isn’t just easy to make. It’s also guaranteed a large consistent audience, and each video will boost the views of all of the other videos. 
    
    Hopefully I’ve sold you on why these are so key. Now, to make them. 
    
    I want you to sit down with the topics you’ve written down, and a list of formats (including the ones discussed in previous videos, and a few new ones you’ve found in your research). Then go through one by one and think of ways you can combine them, to form buckets. 
    
    Take a topic and think of all the different ways you could combine it with a format to make it more fun, more entertaining, more engaging. 
    
    At first I’d recommend writing down as many different combinations as you can. Then once you’ve kind of maximised your potential buckets, go through and pick your favourite 3-5. These will be what you start with on your profile. This is the basics for your early social media strategy. 
    
    So which buckets should you pick? 
    
    Luckily there’s a decent structure for that too. Your general social media strategy should fit the 70:20:10 rule. 
    
    70% of your content should be broad. The vast majority should catch your average everyday viewer and keep them watching. It’s accessible, it’s applicable to pretty much everyone, and it is mainly entertainment. 
    
    Now because we’ve built our buckets from our pillars, your core messaging is still in these videos, but for this you should pick the buckets that aren’t really that high in value - but that people will love watching. 
    
    Now this type of content makes up 70% (approximately) because it gets views, and boosts your profile. This content is key for people to know who you are, recognise your face, and have a positive association with you. These videos will be your biggest viewed, and will bring in some casual followers. They’re your most recognisable buckets. But, they don’t necessarily build community, and they’re definitely not for selling. 
    
    Which is why 20% of your content should then be focussed. These buckets should be slightly more niche and valuable than the broad ones, talking more in depth about your messaging. These are likely to be more educational and expect some level of prior knowledge to really enjoy. Now the fans of these videos will love them. This is proper community building work - but - they won’t really get huge views. 
    
    But that’s ok, the point of these videos is to make people like you, and become a fan of you. So these will probably have a really high conversion rate to followers. All of those people who’ve been sitting around watching your content in silence without following, will likely follow because of this focussed content. 
    
    Then the last 10% of your content, is niche - whether this is selling yourself (as a personal brand) or the company. Now this content will probably get very low views, it won’t grow your profile and likely won’t bring in anyone new. But it is still such an important part of your strategy - as it’s essentially your ‘sale’. These are the best videos to CTA to your course, or your website, your PDF, your newsletter - whatever your lead mag is. So save the niche topics, your founding story, your business growth, for these videos. 
    
    So 70:20:10. Broad:Focussed:Niche
    
    The keen eyed salesmen among you will notice that this is just a funnel. The broad content grabs loads of people, then slowly process and filters them into fans, until you can finally sell to them. . 
    
    So when you pick your buckets, you want them to fit with this general structure. Don’t worry about sticking to it religiously, this is fine to change and model to what you want. If you want rapid growth you can make 100% of it broad. if you need sales you can make 100% of it niche. But this is the general ratio you should stick to, for sustainable growth. 
    
    As an exercise now I’d recommend pausing the video and going through your list, of i think now around 20 buckets, and write down which ones you expect to be broad, focussed or niche. And then choose your favourites, based off of that listing. 
    
    **Quick bonus section on CTAs here.** 
    
    if you are going to follow this structure. Then you can also use this to inform your CTAs - or calls to action - in your videos. 
    In your broad videos, only CTA to a follow, or to another video on your profile. Don’t CTA to anything else, as the people watching won’t be interested enough in you to follow it up, and will probably resent being ‘sold to’. In these, you don’t even have to CTA to anything. 
    
    Then in your focussed videos. Definitely CTA to follow, and use it to make people aware of other platforms (Youtube, podcast etc), lead mags, or services. But don’t sell too hard. Keep it casual. Just plant the seed here. 
    
    Then save the heavy hitters for the niche videos. Your CTA on here shouldn’t be to follow, but to ‘click the link in bio to my free PDF’ ‘subscribe to my newsletter’, ‘follow me on YouTube to be part of my giveaway’. 
    
    Now, you can CTA in every video, but I’ve found keeping this to only the very specific fans just helps people having goodwill with your brand. Too many CTAs and people will get frustrated with you. 
    
    Also if that section went over your head completely - don’t worry - as we’ll be covering CTAs, monetisation and lead mags later on.
