As a business owner your first priority is your business, and so your personal brand should be able to run effectively with minimal input from you.

This video is about the specifics of how to hire a team that can take the entire workload off your back and where to find them.

Naturally, for a creative team, you’re assessing people for three types of skillsets, 

First is the technical ability; you know like can they physically do the labor, do they have experience with the tools/software etc.

Second is soft skills/culture fit, this is largely communication,  and how they fit with the team.

Third, the hard bit, you’re looking for a person who is truly creative. This is the person who’s actually going to go beyond the beaten path and make your content gold. They are also going to be someone who is naturally curious about their craft, and show some sign of refining it beyond the world of work. You want these people at every level, because at every level strategy, ideation, and innovation need to be co occuring – and you can only do that with a team of people who see the brand and the output as their own.  

This module will go over each individual role one by one, what to look out for, how to value them, and what to expect from them. Now it’s likely you’ll be starting off with just one part of a team, or maybe even less
 – In the wrap up at the end, I’ll go over the practicalities, and how to develop a team that can take the load.

**Hiring an editor**

<aside>

1-1.5k per month if overseas

30-45k if in house depending on experience

Best traits: studious, comfortable communicator, objective eye, creative

</aside>

A brilliant editor can be from anywhere in the world, as long as they’re able to communicate within office hours, and are motivated working by themselves.

It’s also the thing you are most likely to delegate first, usually overseas on on fiverr to whoever has the portfolio that ‘looks about right’ and spend as little money as humanly possible on

We’d recommend hiring overseas as a cost efficient, smart way to find editors that are primed to take on short form work.

To hire an editor anywhere, you want someone that is:

- Studious
- Great with communication (especially overseas)
- Able to think critically, and show restraint
- Able to understand when to be creative and when to toe the line

Primarily, they’ll be working long hours by themselves, with a working relationship with you our your producer that is 70% made up of revisions and tweaks. They need to thrive with all of this.

Even if you’re the nicest boss in the world, revisions are a necessity to help get to a polished final product. Therefore it is essential the editor is happy with a back and forth.

An editor overseas might cost a grand per month, where an editor in the uk may cost 40k per year. If you or your team has a strong producer skillset, hiring overseas is your best bet as you can use those skills to train the overseas editor.

If your looking for more of a ready made, highly skilled editor, you will likely want to hire domestically.

Hiring overseas is cost efficient, but not for the faint of heart. we’ve seen:

- complete fakers
- people pretending to be individuals and passing off an agency’s work as their own
- people who literally just dip.

The best way to start this process is put out a job advert on sites like Online Jobs (phillipines). You will get a lot of applicants.

Select the best ones (try and look past the cringey crypto videos - youve got to do what youve got. to do)

And offer them a trial video.

Give them the assets for a standard video youve made, and give them a clear brand guide they need to follow. In this process your looking for them to:

- come back within a day or two (unless they communicate otherwise)
- Send a video with the correct fonts, good framing and sensible cuts.

If the above two work, and you’ve met them over zoom and they’re trustworthy, you probably have someone who’s at very least trainable.

Start them on about 3 videos for week 1, expect a lot of revisions.

You need an editor to eventually ramp up to two (short) videos per day. As they start working with you, kindly send revisions, and monitor how receptive they are, and how quick their turn arounds are.

You can decide whether to keep them on based on these: after a month, 

- can they do 2 videos a day?
- Are they “getting” it - have you given clear instructions they’re able to follow, and are they using common sense?

Most editors are rudimental at best at colour grading. Pay a one off fee to freelancers on upwork/fiverr to setup a standard colour grade. Remember you will need a new grade every time your environment/lighting changes.

**Hiring a videographer:**

<aside>

£400-600 day rate

Key Skills: task focused, happy following someone elses creative direction. Strong portfolio

</aside>

Videographers are easy to find: if you get one, they need to be on site and available for each shoot, and they need to have a good portfolio. 

Try one out, see if you get along with them and if not try someone else!

A standard day rate in london might be between £350-600. Finding the right videographer is a process of trial and error, but most with a good portfolio are a fairly safe bet. 

If you have a camera, and are happy to shoot with a fixed setup, you might want to save the cost of a videographer and shoot yourself. This is where understanding set and lighting becomes incredibly important. Having a good camera does not mean that you will automatically look good.

At any rate, whether you hire a videographer, hire someone to setup your studio, or decide to do it yourself, paying attention to how your footage looks and where your shooting is extremely important for the visual credibility of your operation, and, as mentioned in the Lo-Fi module, keeps people connected to you

Very importantly, a GREAT videographer is not the price-tag of their equipment but the skills beyond that. An expensive car is useless when driven by a toddler, and so is all that expensive ‘camera-stuff’. A great videographer is experienced in both editing, and pre-production – they know exactly what a the next person in the pipeline needs, and acts in a way to make their life easier. KEY WORD – Redundancy  – They have back-up microphones, they record in wider color gamut, they get a little more in frame than necessary – and they have a quick method to get your editor all necessary files. If you’re likely to be shooting with just you and your videographer present, then someone with the ability to direct is essential, but we can touch on that in the producer section.

**Hiring a producer**

<aside>

£40-60k

Key Skills: Organisation, Vision, Communication, Dedication

</aside>

The producer brings each role together. A great producer is an every man who is able to take the vision of the project and coordinate each team member to deliver it. They need to be vision orientated, detail obsessed, a great communicator whos dedicated to get the job done.

They should have a good knowledge of both the creative and technical, and be able to deliver your vision (or have the vision themselves). 

Direction - 

We hired Aydan from film & TV, Joden came from film school. But both of them had a history on Tiktok. 

Find someone with a technical background, but a demonstrable understanding of short form.

Producers can be all-rounders, they might be everything from researcher, scriptwriter, videographer, editor, and graphic designer – for a lot of people this is a role that is grown into, this could be the first person you hire to manage your content.

Being a highly valuable member of the team, producers are paid anywhere from £40-60k

<aside>

£35-45k

Key Skills: Studious, dedicated, creative, on trend

</aside>

**Hiring a writer:** 

Your writer needs to be a short form native, whos happy, like the editors, to sit in a room and just write.

Putting out 30 videos (at least!) per month is not easy, but there are many fantastic, bright, tiktok savvy students that have just come from writing long dissertations. Looking for a writer, traditional scriptwriting methods dont really apply here, so hiring young and training will likely work.

Many are tempted to hire an overseas writer. Here’s why we never have: 

There are nuances in posting to a local audience (which is where your content will go first) that just wont translate if its written by someone across the world.

Find a bright, eager, person who doesnt mind spending most of their day writing. Test for their knowledge of current trends and ask in the interview the content they’d like to put out for certain people.

Your writer should be constantly on the pulse and searching for the next big thing. make sure thats how they are.

A writer will likely cost £30-45k per year and will be an absolutely essential part of your team.

OUTRO 

So how do we bring it all together to actually start creating content?

First, as you yourself get used to the process, you need to make lean decisions and hire key members gradually. 

Fundamentally, ready baked creatives who understand what works on social media are very hard to come by, But, nothing is stopping you from putting one in the oven yourself.

So, if you can’t find a seasoned producer, you will have to make one. And the best producers are made from practical roles.

So, whilst your fully developed team might look like an editor in the phillipines, a freelance videographer, a writer a producer, and whatever else, you may want to start, especially if you yourself are not technical, with one key role.

A videographer/editor

Many videographers will be able to edit. 

In the early stages of your personal brand, having one person responsible for the creative, will help narrow down the vision, and, 

Train the right videographer\editor for long enough, and they will develop the strategic eye you need for them to become a producer. 

Then, once you have a producer focused on driving momentum, managing the team and keeping an eye on strategy, you can hire in freelancers to support them. 

As your video operation grows, add an editor and a writer to take the biggest time burden off of your producer’s hands, then have your producer look for videographers who really know their salt.

Ultimately, you want a team that self manages, and the best way to do that is understanding how to keep each of them motivated and develop key players along the way.
