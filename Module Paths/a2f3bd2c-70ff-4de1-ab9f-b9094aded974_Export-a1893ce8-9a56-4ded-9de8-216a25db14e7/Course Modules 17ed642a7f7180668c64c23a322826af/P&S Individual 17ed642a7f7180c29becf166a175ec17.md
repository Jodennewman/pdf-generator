Growing an engaged and committed audience is the key to long term success in the content space. How do you achieve that longevity? Community management and feed appearance. 

Imagine a perfectly curated channel with brilliantly shot videos, crisp audio, bullet proof scripts and catchy hooks. Amazing right? It’s what we’re all striving for. BUT. The creator doesn't engage in the comments and they're only posting once or twice a month. You’ll notice that this well crafted content just isn’t getting the overall engagement it deserves. 

This is because the creators post management and scheduling is simply not up to scratch. 

Firstly, from our experience in growing accounts, if a creator is actively participating in their comment section. Driving discussion and fostering real community, the viewer count and follower conversion is far superior. 

Secondly, something that so often causes account to flicker out and die is poor scheduling. You need to make your creation and posting process as smooth as possible to allow you some lead time on posts. That way when you inevitably have a day that you just can’t give your content the time it needs, you can still have something ready to go.

This is where tools like Metricool become invaluable. Metricool simplifies the entire posting process by letting you plan and schedule content ahead of time. Instead of manually posting each piece of content, you can set up a week or month's worth of posts in one sitting. It also helps you understand when your audience is most active, so you can time your posts perfectly without having to be online at odd hours. The best part is that it works across multiple platforms, so you can manage all your social media presence from one place, saving you precious time that you can spend creating better content or engaging with your community.

What makes Metricool particularly useful for growing platforms is its analytics features. You can see exactly how your posts are performing, track your follower growth, and understand which content resonates most with your audience. This data helps you make smarter decisions about what to post and when to post it, leading to better engagement and faster growth.
