Let’s talk about the importance of respecting and understanding content on short form platforms, specificaly the content that isn’t like yours.

If you’re watching this course, I’m guessing your short form inspiration list will include creators like, Stephen Bartlett, Codie Sanchez, or the Hormozis (Leila and or Alex)

And I’m guessing it probably WON’T include your standard influencers, the types doing “get ready with mes” or “makeup tutorials”. 

Now that’s all well and good. You want to make profesional personal brand or brand content, not fashion videos. BUT. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be taking inspiration from creators on the platform as a WHOLE.  Especially the ones who’ve built their content from the GROUND UP. 

The first thing to realise is that your inspiration creators like Stephen, Codie and the Hormozis didn’t **start** on short form. They built large audiences in other places like podcasts, YouTube, speaking gigs - *before* they moved onto these platforms. That means they already had **brand recognition** and fans who moved over. They were’t starting from scratch. 

So they can post a video that’s not perfectly optimised short-form, and it’ll still get traction - because people already know who they are, which means they can bypass the **meritocracy** aspect of short form.

If you’re starting content from zero, you can’t rely on that kind of recognition. You need truly engaging, platform-friendly content that hooks **complete strangers** in the first seconds.

Which is why, the classic influencers can be more helpful when understdaning the basics of organic growth. Many of them gained tens of millions of followers with no pre-existing fame.

These creators PERFECTED the most powerful tools in short form growth: hooking, authenticity, community, retention and engagement. So understanding, respecting and analysisng how THEY do it, will help you to understand how YOU should do it too. 

See, in its purest form, short-form video is raw, immediate, and unfiltered. It’s ‘lo-fi’ thinksomeone ranting in their car, or casually chatting while making breakfast. The heart of i all is that feeling that you’re on FaceTime with a friend, getting an authentic glimpse into someone elses life. And this genuine feeling connection is exactly what keeps people glued to TikTok and Instagram Reels for hours.

The thing is. Most of their content is not authentic. Big influencers strategise and batch content too - but they’ve  mastered it not FEELING like that. 

And that’s exactly why you should **respect and study** even the random, everyday influencers. They figured out how to make the feed work for them, how to keep viewers from scrolling away, and how to build real community. By combining those lo-fi, authentic techniques with a bit of professional flair, you’ll tap into the emotional core that makes people want to watch and follow.

**Lo-fi** isn’t about dumbing down your brand. It’s about recognizing what people actually love about short-form—raw, relatable, and *real*. Master that, and everything else becomes so much easier.

    **The Importance of Lo-Fi — Respecting & Understanding Content That’s Not Like Yours**
    
    Let’s talk about the **importance of respecting and understanding content** on the platforms that isn’t like yours.
    
    If you’re watching this course, I’m guessing your content inspiration list will include creators like Stephen Bartlett, Codie Sanchez, or the Hormozis. And I’m guessing it probably **won’t** include your standard influencers—the types doing “get ready with me” videos or makeup tutorials.
    
    Now, that’s all well and good. You want to make professional personal brand or business content, not fashion videos. **But** that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be taking inspiration from creators on the platform as a **whole**.
    
    Any big creator—especially these kinds of influencers—goes viral because they’ve perfected the four biggest drivers of short-form content: **authenticity, community, retention, and engagement.** Understanding, respecting, and analyzing how *they* do it will help you figure out how *you* should do it.
    
    See, in its purest form, short-form video is **raw, immediate, and unfiltered**. Think of someone ranting in their car or casually chatting while making breakfast. The heart of it is that feeling that you’re on FaceTime with a friend, getting an authentic glimpse into someone’s thoughts and life. This genuine connection is exactly what keeps people glued to TikTok and Instagram Reels for hours.
    
    **Why You Shouldn’t Just Copy the Big Names You Know**
    
    The first thing to realize is that creators like Stephen Bartlett, Codie Sanchez, and the Hormozis didn’t **start** from scratch on TikTok or Reels. They built large audiences elsewhere—podcasts, YouTube, speaking gigs—*before* they really committed to short-form. That means they already have **brand recognition** and fans who carry over to new platforms.
    
    They can post a video clip that might not be perfectly optimized for short-form, and it’ll still get traction. People already know who they are, so they can skip some of the **meritocracy** aspects of the feed. If you’re starting from zero, you can’t rely on that kind of name recognition. You need truly engaging, platform-friendly content that hooks **complete strangers** in the first seconds.
    
    That’s why, ironically, the **“get ready with me”** or makeup tutorial folks can be more instructive. Many of them gained millions of followers with no pre-existing fame. They didn’t have giant email lists or brand sponsorships—just raw, relatable, well-tailored content that resonated with the algorithms and the audience.

    Let’s talk about the **importance of respecting and understanding ALL content** on short-form platforms - and not just the content that similar to yours. 
    
    If you’re watching this, I’m guessing your inspiration list is people like Stephen Bartlett, Codie Sanchez, or Alex and Leila Hormozi. They’re all super successful and have these slickly produced videos. They make it look easy, right?
    
    I’m guessing the people who aren
    
    But **here’s the thing**: they grew big audiences on other platforms *before* they really went all-in on short-form. They already had name recognition, big email lists, and loyal fans from places like YouTube or podcasts. If you’re starting at zero, copying their final format might be misleading. They don’t *have* to rely on the feed alone for growth—people already know them from somewhere else.
    
    A lot of entrepreneurs I talk to will say, “We want to do it like Hormozi,” or “We want a Stephen Bartlett vibe,” but they never mention all the ordinary “get ready with me” or makeup influencers. The irony is, it’s often those “ordinary” folks who cracked the **short-form code** from scratch, building millions of followers without any pre-existing fame. They mastered a type of authenticity, community-building, and raw connection that big names can sometimes skip over because they’re already known.
    
    **The Meritocracy of the Feed**
    
    In a lot of ways, short-form video is a meritocracy. If your content is genuinely interesting, if it feels personal and is well-tailored to the platform, it can blow up—no matter who you are. But if you’re already a star, you can skip half that process. People see a familiar face and watch, no matter how you edited it. If you’re not famous, though, you’ve got to capture them in those **first two seconds**.
    
    Some big creators rely on a “quantity approach”—pumping out multiple daily posts, or paying for entire teams to clip everything they say and plaster it everywhere. That can work if you’re already huge or have a big budget to burn. But for most people, it’s a gamble. Survivorship bias is real: we see the few who blow up, and not the many who crash and burn, spending tons of money for zero traction.
    
    **Why “Overly Serious” Doesn’t Land**
    
    These platforms thrive on spontaneity and personal connection—like glimpses of your daily life, comedic rants, or raw emotional moments. That’s why purely professional, super-serious content often feels **disconnected**. If everything is stiff and corporate, it clashes with the culture of short-form, where people binge-watch candid, off-the-cuff clips.
    
    But that doesn’t mean you can’t use a studio or film with good equipment. That’s where the “founder paradox” comes in. You want to look credible and polished, yet also relatable—like you just grabbed your phone and started talking. That’s where **lo-fi** style can be your best friend.
    
    **How to Seem Lo-Fi While Staying Professional**
    
    One of my favorite strategies is an **“elevated green screen.”** Instead of using the TikTok or Reels built-in green screen (which can look glitchy), film yourself on a proper camera, then mask yourself out in After Effects, CapCut, or Descript. It still feels like that classic “person in front of an article or screenshot” format people love, but it’s a little cleaner.
    
    **Scripting** is another biggie. You can use bullet points, or even a teleprompter, but practice reading in a natural tone. Work on your eye movement, your vocal inflections, and sprinkle in the occasional “uh,” “like,” or “um” (in moderation) to sound off-the-cuff. People on TikTok or Reels are hyper-aware of that stiff, corporate cadence. If they sense you’re in robot mode, they’ll scroll away.
    
    **“Fake Authenticity” Isn’t Malicious**
    
    Sometimes founders worry about “faking authenticity.” But honestly, most influencers—big or small—are batching their content, changing outfits, and pretending it’s filmed on different days. That’s just how you fit into a consistent posting schedule. It’s not *dishonest* if it’s still **you**, still your actual insights. Short-form watchers are used to that sort of production magic. They just want to *feel* like it’s spontaneous, even if they know at some level it isn’t.
    
    Dress like you do in real life. Unless you’re a doctor who actually wears scrubs daily, a suit and tie can scream “corporate marketing video.” Stick to T-shirts or casual outfits if that’s really who you are. Same goes for your filming backdrop—throw in a plant, a coffee mug, maybe some books or a lamp. It should look like a cozy home office, not a sterile film set.
    
    **Less Production, More Consistency**
    
    One huge advantage of a simple home setup is that it **reduces friction**. If you only shoot in a big fancy studio, you’ll probably do it once a month and eventually burn out. Meanwhile, some small influencer is recording daily in their bedroom, building a tighter connection with their audience. *That’s* the power of lo-fi: it lets you show up more often, and that consistency builds trust.
    
    **Fast Food vs. Lobster & Caviar**
    
    You’ve probably heard me say this before: short-form viewers want a quick, tasty fast-food burger. If you show up with lobster and caviar, they might not even try it. In other words, you can’t force an overly formal, “fine dining” vibe onto people who are on TikTok in line at Starbucks. The solution is to serve them a **really good burger**—one that’s better than the average, but still hits that immediate, casual craving.
    
    **When “Less Is More”**
    
    If your short-form isn’t working, the default reaction is often, “I need more editing, more special effects, more angles.” But on these platforms, that can backfire. Viewers might see it as overly manufactured. Sometimes the best thing is to **trim the fat** and let your personality come through. Let it be direct, personable, and genuinely human.
    
    And watch out for “over-polishing” pitfalls like odd color grading or harsh lighting. Remember: short-form watchers are used to bright, natural, or even *slightly messy* visuals. If your highlights are blown out or your color looks weirdly cinematic, it might seem off-putting. Plus, LinkedIn likes and comments can be misleading—people on LinkedIn are nice. A post that gets applause there might flop on TikTok, where honest feedback comes in the form of instant swipes.
    
    **Production Value Should Be “Felt,” Not Seen**
    
    You can definitely have **great lighting, crisp audio, and solid editing**, but it should feel effortless. If it’s too obviously professional, it breaks the illusion of one-to-one authenticity. Think about setting up a soft key light slightly off-center, using a simple hair light from a window, and calling it a day. That’s all you need to look polished without screaming, “This is a TV commercial!”
    
    **Why Famous Creators Get Away with More**
    
    Let’s be real: if people already know who you are, you can get away with minimal hooking or broader topics. Alex Hormozi, for instance, can talk about big relationship tips or random life hacks, and it blows up because he’s *Alex Hormozi.* Meanwhile, if you’re Joe or Jane Nobody, you’ll need a *very* strong opening line or concept to catch attention.
    
    You’ll also notice some big names just post **podcast clips** and still get traction. That’s because they’re already recognized. For a new face, a random clip of you speaking into a mic might not gain traction—unless the content is *extremely* compelling.
    
    **Everyone Is Staging Something**
    
    Trust me, even the biggest “get ready with me” creators are staging parts of their routine. They’ll batch film a day’s worth of content in different outfits. People only notice it if it feels forced. But if it’s done well, it still *feels* natural. So don’t stress about your process. Just keep that sense of immediacy front and center.
    
    **Hooking People Who Don’t Know You**
    
    Ultimately, short form is about hooking the uninterested. You’re tapping an algorithm that shows your clip to a bunch of strangers. If they don’t know your brand or your name, you’ve got seconds to make them care. That’s why adopting some lo-fi techniques—authentic speech, simple backgrounds, personal angles—can help you stand out in a feed full of quick takes.
    
    **Remember**: The established personalities you admire can bypass some of these steps. You can’t. So embrace the rawness of short-form, reflect the culture that thrives on immediate, relatable content, and let your gear and editing skills quietly support you—*without* overshadowing the personal connection.
    
    **Final Thoughts**
    
    In the end, short-form is this weird mix of authenticity and performance—kind of like how early TV had laugh tracks and cheesy sets, yet still managed to captivate audiences. People will accept that parts of your video are “produced” if the vibe feels warm and personal. Focus on that feeling. Let them sense there’s a real human behind the camera, not a polished marketing robot. **That’s** how you honor the lo-fi spirit while still aiming to build a professional brand.
