Ok so your video has flopped. You’ve only got a few hundred views, it’s not going anywhere, and now you need to work out what went wrong, and what you need to fix next time. The way to do that is by checking your metrics. 

Metrics are just your likes, your comments, your shares, saves and your retention - how long people watch your video for. 

So i’ll start with likes. Likes are probably the least important of all metrics. Getting loads won’t get your video pushed in the algorithm. But in general, you want about 10% likes to views on your video. This is a great signifier early on that your video will get pushed. 

Next is saves. People save videos simply because they think they’re valuable, so if you’ve got a high save rate, it means you’re video provides value. If saves are really low, then the video probably doesn’t. This is also not the most important metric, loads of saves won’t get your video pushed, but it is a good insight into what your audience got out of your video (or didn’t).

Next is shares. Now shares are very important to getting your video pushed. Even if you’ve got almost no likes comments or saves, high shares, will get your video pushed alone. This is because a share sends a notification to a new viewer, which gets that person onto the platform (which the algorithm likes and rewards). Now the way to maximise for shares, is to first understand why people share things. In general people share things to their friends, and it’s usually because they want credit for finding something cool, or because it reminds them of them. So the way to optimise this is for your video to include reference to something people will usually talk about with their friends. Now this can be pretty nebulous, but if you reference a popular film, or fandom, you will probably have a slightly higher share count. Or just be funny. Funny videos tend to be high on shares too. 

Ok the next metric you need to look at is retention. That’s the graph on your analytics that shows how long people in average watched your video for. Now you’ll always see this spike and drop off at the beginning, because even for a viral video, most people won’t get past the hook, but you do want as many people as possible to fully complete the video. The algorithm will push a video if more people stay to the end. The way to optimise this is through the hook - deliver - rehook structure we went through in the scripting section. If you’re retention graph drops down like this [mimic sharp drop off] people are getting bored. 

And finally, probably the most important metric of them all, comments. Now comments alone aren’t a great metric, but they’re important because of their impact on watch time. Your video can be incredibly boring, but if it’s got a really good comment section, people will sit there and read the whole thing, which is GREAT for your retention. Now there’s two main ways to optimise for comments. People will either comment if they really want to, or if they need to. The way to get people to really want to, is often to give them an opportunity to make a joke, to write something funny. This one is generally a bit harder to control. The easiest one to optimise for is someone NEEDING to comment. And the best way to optimise for this, is to do something wrong, and not address it. Using the wrong word, spelling something wrong, or just straight up rage bait. If you’ve made a mistake, people feel the need to point it out. So if you’re going through a dry spell, the most important thing is finding a way for people to comment. 

So if your video flops, you can look at all of those different things. But in reality the most important two are comments, and shares. Optimise for those and you’ll probably have a viral video.

    So metrics, what are they, why do we need them. Well maybe your video has flopped, and you need to figure out why, so you can stop it happening again. The easiest way is to look at your engagement metrics—namely your likes, saves, shares, retention, and comments—and see where the problem might be.
    
    ### Likes
    
    Now likes aren’t the most important metric, but still worth looking at. Getting a ton of likes won’t necessarily push you up in the algorithm, but aiming for around 10% likes compared to views is a decent benchmark.
    
    ### Saves
    
    Saves are again good, but not super important to the algorithm. A high number of saves indicates your viewers found your video valuable or worth revisiting. While saves won’t single-handedly make your video go viral, they’re still a good sign that you delivered real value. So if a video you thought was valuable has NO saves, it’s worth rethinking. 
    
    ### Shares
    
    Shares are *extremely* important. If a lot of people share your video it can still do really well even without many likes or comments. Now viewers typically share content because it’s funny, relatable, or tied to something cool they want to show a friend. Tap into popular culture, a fandom, or humour is a great way to up your share rate. 
    
    ### Retention
    
    Retention is basically just another word for how long people watched your video for. The algorithm loves it when people watch to the end. Although all retention graphs will have this spike shape, if your graph drops off immediately early, and noones getting to the end, it’s a sign your content gets boring or confusing. Use strong hooks and re-hooks to keep viewers around.
    
    ### Comments
    
    And finally, arguably the most important metric of them all, comments. Even if your video is boring, if it’s got a great comment section people will stick around to read the comments which massively increases your watch time. Luckily there are loads of ways to encourage people to comment, one is just simply giving them space to make a joke, another more hacky way is ot leave in a small ‘mistake’, and letting the people in the comments correct you - they ALWAYS will. 
    
    In the end, **shares and comments** are the biggest drivers of viral success, so focus on creating content that people *must* share or *need* to comment on. If you boost those two metrics, you’ll be on track to a viral video.
