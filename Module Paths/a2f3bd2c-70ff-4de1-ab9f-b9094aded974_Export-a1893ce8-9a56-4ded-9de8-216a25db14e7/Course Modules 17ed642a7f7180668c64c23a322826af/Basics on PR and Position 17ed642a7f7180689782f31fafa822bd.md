We can call it views, followers or revenue, but fundamentally what you and I are doing on the internet is building *our reputation*.

Your reputation is fundamentally the most important part of your career, and this entire course is about teaching you to build an extensive, positive reputation based on trust and wide viewership on the internet.

But to be able to do that, and maintain trust with the people that know you, understanding the fundamentals of PR is essential.

PR is all about understanding yourself, who you’re trying to be and where your trying to get to. Remember that whilst your Mum will tell all her friends that you’re a nice guy, the world will only see you through a tiny window of time - maximum a few minutes a day.

Nuanced opinions are rarely summed up in a minute, and the internet is quick to judge, so you need to do the work on exactly who you are and where your going now, so you can emanate all the right things in that small window of time

Don’t worry - we’ll guide you through

So, to start, I’ve got some questions to ask you - grab a note pad, pause the video and have a think. It’ll make sense later

- Who are you (what has led you to this point?)
- What do you care about the most?
- **What are you ultimately trying to achieve?**
- **What specific problem are your audience facing?**
- **How do you see your brand evolving over the next 3 years?**

Understanding these questions will help you build what we call a brand guide.

Even if no one else will be working on your content, building a brand guide so that you know exactly how you want to come across will save a lot of umming, arring and wasted time in the long run. 

So, even if its you by yourself, its important next to write out a brand guide. You need to pigeon hole yourself to see how it looks, as thats exactly what viewers will do to you

Right now, get a pen and paper. Look at the answers you gave to the questions and write out your dos and donts as if you were explaining to an martian. 

let me explain: imagine an influencer called leo.

### **LEO DOES**

1. **Champion High-Quality Content**
2. **Maintain a Supportive, Encouraging Tone**
3. **Engage Authentically with Followers**
4. **Support Meaningful Partnerships & Causes**
5. **Stay Transparent About Setbacks**

---

### **LEO DOES NOT**

1. **Spread Negative or Misleading Information**
2. **Comment on Politically Divisive Issues Unrelated to His Expertise**
3. **Endorse Quick-Fix Products or Services**
4. **Engage in Public Feuds or Personal Attacks**
5. **Sacrifice Quality for Urgency**

Once you’ve created a clear list like this, you’ve got the brand fundamentals and are ready to move onto positioning.

In many of your videos, its likely to be incredibly important to show credibility. A cliched example of this is, if your a doctor, having a stethoscope nearby, or a scientist with a lab jacket. Having some visual aid to build credibility partnered with a rehearsed elevator pitch that puts you exactly where you want to be will be the best way to position yourself for a short form audience.

So, so far you:

- Know who you are, where your going and what you want
- Understand your red lines and know how to communicate it to your team
- understand the importance of building credibility through visuals and an elevator pitch

The pitch is something you need to be able to pull out within content using the insecure kid effect.

It’s likely in many pieces of content you will need to both show why you are an authority and ocassionally sell what you’ve been working on. 

To do this, you need to act like an insecure child, trying to fit his latest achievement into unrelated sentences to show you how great he is.

“I went to buy milk from the shops (after I had built an entire Hogwarts castle on minecraft) and I was thinking…”

“Yes Jenny. I’d like to go on a date (you know, ive been building an entire hogwarts castle on minecraft this week) so it’d be nice to get out”

In a similar way, you might want to insert who you are, to demonstrate why you are worth listening to 

“here are my top 7 tips to being a musician (as Justin Bieber’s ex manager)” 

“This teacher is the worst (I ran a school with over 1000 students) and I’d never do that”

This might feel embarassing, or bragadocious, but when you have a minute to explain to people who you are, tell them a great story, and leave them hooked, people tend to give you a pass. Don’t worry about bragging. It’s incredibly important for your reputation.

**“PR Basics for Creators & Entrepreneurs: Building and Protecting Your Public Image”**

---

## **1. Introduction & Purpose**

**Key Message**:

Effective PR isn’t just for Fortune 500 companies. **Creators** and **entrepreneurs** can—*and should*—leverage foundational PR principles to manage their reputations, grow their visibility, and build trust with audiences.

### **1.1 Why PR Matters**

- **Establishes Credibility**: Helps you stand out in a crowded market by shaping how the public perceives you.
- **Creates Lasting Impressions**: Positive media coverage can influence future customers, collaborators, or investors.
- **Manages Risk**: Puts you in control of the narrative, especially if negative stories or misunderstandings arise.

---

## **2. Setting Up Your Personal/Business Narrative**

**Goal**: Define how you want to be known before you start any PR activities.

### **2.1 Identifying Core Values & Messaging**

- **Self-Assessment**: List three to five brand attributes you want associated with your name or company (e.g., innovation, reliability, humor).
- **Narrative Alignment**: Ensure content, public statements, and even social media bios reflect these key attributes.

### **2.2 Crafting a Clear Elevator Pitch**

- **Short & Punchy**: In one or two sentences, convey who you are, what you do, and why it matters.
- **Consistency**: Use this pitch across interviews, networking events, and official bios to maintain a cohesive image.

---

## **3. Understanding the Media Landscape**

**Goal**: Know where and how to present your story.

### **3.1 Different Types of Media Outlets**

- **Traditional (Newspapers, TV, Radio)**: Often offer higher perceived credibility.
- **Digital Publications (Blogs, Online Magazines)**: May reach niche audiences aligned with your brand.
- **Podcasts & YouTube**: Growing in popularity for long-form discussions and targeted fanbases.

### **3.2 Media Prioritization**

- **Audience Fit**: Focus on outlets that speak to your ideal community (e.g., a tech startup might target Wired or TechCrunch).
- **Reach vs. Relevance**: A small but loyal audience might be more valuable than a large generic one.

---

## **4. Pitching & Building Relationships with Journalists**

**Goal**: Secure positive coverage by standing out from the flood of daily pitches.

- **Why It Matters**: Highlight what makes your news relevant to their readers/viewers.
- **Supporting Materials**: Include basic data, quotes, or high-quality images—no fluff.

### **4.3 Follow-Up**

- **Be Polite & Brief**: Journalists are busy. A short nudge a week after your initial pitch is appropriate.
- **Respect Boundaries**: If they’re not interested, don’t burn bridges. A no now can turn into a yes later.

---

**Goal**: Ensure consistency between formal PR activities and everyday online interaction.

### **5.1 Social Media Consistency**

### **6.1 Crisis Communication Basics**

- **Fact Gathering**: Verify details internally before making public statements.
