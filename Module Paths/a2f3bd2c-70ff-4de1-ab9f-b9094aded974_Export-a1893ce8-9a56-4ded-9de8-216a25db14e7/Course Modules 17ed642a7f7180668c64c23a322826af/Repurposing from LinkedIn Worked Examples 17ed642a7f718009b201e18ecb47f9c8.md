Let’s talk about about repurposing. So you’ll be glad to know that you don’t need to reinvent the wheel with all of your content on short form. If you have a LinkedIn presence, you will definitely have a lot of copy on your LinkedIn that can transfer over to TikTok, even if a lot of things said in this course has led you to believe otherwise — a lot of your core messaging and stories can be used for short video content. 

Or maybe you don’t post there much but you see a lot of great posts on topics you’d like to speak on in video, like someone you follow who has great posts and talks about exactly the right stuff. If it performed GREAT on there, there’s a decent chance it will perform well on short form – that’s still validation, it’s still people at the end of the day.  

BUT the problem is that viewers on short form platforms typically hate everything LinkedIn stands for, in the same way that for many people, their ‘down-time self’ hates talking business. 

So when the post is repurposed to video, it’s got to look unrecognisable from the original. It is still the same content, this isn’t a lot of work–  there’s just a few kind of filters the post needs to go through before it makes a good video, - Unless it’s Ken Cheng. That guy’s hilarious. 

So in this lesson I’m going to go through three different generic types of LinkedIn post, and rewrite them for short form. 

The first type of post that’s great to repurpose, and my personal favourite for clients (because it’s the easiest to do) is the listicle. As we’ve already discussed, top fives, top tens, do incredibly well. 

So a generic linkedin post you *might* have something similar to, would look like 

**7 harsh truths EVERY employee needs to hear** 

If you want to stand out and reach your full potential, read this now:

**1.** **Your Job Title Doesn’t Define Your Value**

↳ You’re more than your role on an org chart.

↳ Focus on the impact you make, not just the label you hold.

**2. Hard Work Alone Won’t Guarantee Recognition**

↳ If you don’t speak up or show results, nobody else will do it for you.

↳ Learn to advocate for yourself—visibility matters.

**3. Growth Is Your Own Responsibility**

↳ Don’t wait for a promotion or mentor to spark your progress.

↳ Seek learning opportunities and expand your skill set on your own terms.

**4. Your Attitude Shapes the Team Environment**

↳ Energy is contagious; negativity can stifle productivity.

↳ Choose to uplift others, and they’ll do the same for you.

**5. Work-Life Balance Requires Boundaries**

↳ No one else will protect your personal time.

↳ Set clear limits to maintain both productivity and well-being.

**6. Failure Is Part of the Process**

↳ Every setback is a chance to learn and pivot.

↳ The most resilient employees become the most valuable.

**7. Complacency Kills Progress**

↳ If you’re coasting, you’re falling behind.

↳ Always aim for new challenges—staying curious keeps you indispensable.

Number 3 was the key reminder for me 😅

Which of these lessons resonated the most with you?

Let me know in the comments ⬇️

Ok so you get the vibe. This kind of stuff is all over LinkedIn, and works for a reason. it’s simple, it catches people emotionally, and it’s easy to read all of it. Let’s get into how we’d turn it into a short form script. 

First, 7 is quite a lot of points to make. And not all of them are interesting enough for short form. Cut the fluff. I think a script will work better with just 5 points. I’m going to cut out ‘complacency kills progress, and growth is your own responsibility’. As I just don’t htink they’re as intereseting as the others. 

Next I’m going to change the ordering. So the five points we have are:

**1.** **Your Job Title Doesn’t Define Your Value
2. Hard Work Alone Won’t Guarantee Recognition**

**3. Your Attitude Shapes the Team Environment**

**4. Work-Life Balance Requires Boundaries**

**5. Failure Is Part of the Process**

In the helpful formats section we spoke about optimisng the order of listilces so the most interesting ones are towards the start, and then right at the end. I’d rearrange to talk about them in this order:

1.  Hard work won’t guarantee recognition 

1. work life balance requires boundaries 
2. failure is part of the process
3. your job title doesn’t define your value 
4. your attitude shapes the team environment. 

The most boring is number four, the most interesting numbers 1 and 5. Next wording. This wording is a bit flat, and we can definitely reword it a little, so it sounds more controversial (and will therefore generate WAY more discussion in the comments). 

I’d reword these to. 

1. Working hard doesn’t get you a promotion. 
2. Work life balance is YOUR responsibility - not the companies 
3. You have to fail 
4. Your job title is meaningless
5. A bad team environment, is your fault - fix your attitude. 

All the same more points. But definitely a little more up for incorrect interpretation. Don’t worry though, as we’ll do some damage control as we bolster out the script. Just like this. 

1. Working hard won’t get you a promotion. 

If YOU don’t speak up for yourself, nobody else will, and your hard work will go unnoticed. Start speaking up. 

1. Work life balance is YOUR responsibility - not the companies.

If you don’t set clear personal boundaries, your managers will think you’re ok with working overtime. Its never too late to start setting these.

1. You have to fail. 

Every setback is an opportunity. This resilience will make you more valuable. Trust me. 

1. Your job title is meaningless. 

The real value you bring to a company, is the work you do, not the label you hold. If you find this role has changed since you started. It might time to ask for a pay rise and a job title change. 

1. And finally, now I might get a lot of hate for this one. A bad team environment is your fault - fix your attitude. 

Yes, some companies are just toxic. But you get what you give. And if you come in negative, that will come straight back at you. 

I’ve just taken the copy from the OG post, made it slightly more impactful, more to the point, concise and emotionally effective. Plus dampened the controversial re-spinning of the hook so I’m not saying anything damaging. I also added a little rehook for number five, just to keep people straight to the end (and also farm for comments - always). 

Then all we’ve got left is the hook. now the first line of the inspo post was ‘7 harsh truths every employee needs to hear’. And this is a hook, but we can reword it to fit short-form better - the phrase ‘harsh truths’ is so linkedin. And remember linkedin = corporate = cardinal sin number 3. 

So a better alternative is. 

I won’t promote an employee, no matter how great they are, if they haven’t worked out these five things. 

Now this works as it’s clear straight away what the video is going to be about. It starts off with a controversial statement, and It asks a lot of questions. Mainly - shit, am I accidentally doing one of these five things? Meaning it speaks to a fear and an anxiety - two very strong emotions - that most people have. Plus the ‘i won’t promote’ adds some authority, it’s clear you’re at least a manager. And the final element is that everyone sees themself as a GREAT employee. You don’t need to say ‘you’ for people to self identify. 

I’d also couple this with a text hook. 

‘5 reasons you’re NOT getting promoted’

Short, snappy, to the point. It hits that emotion on the head. 

And then I’ll throw in a little cta to comment at the end. 

So this original script [get linkedin post on screen] Has turned into. 

Text Hook: 5 reasons you’re NOT getting promoted

I won’t promote an employee, no matter how great they are, if they haven’t worked out these five things. 

Number one: Working hard won’t get you a promotion. 

If YOU don’t speak up for yourself, nobody else will, and your hard work will go unnoticed. Start speaking up. 

Number two: Work life balance is YOUR responsibility - not the companies.

If you don’t set clear personal boundaries, your managers will think you’re ok with working overtime. Its never too late to start setting these.

Number three: You have to fail. 

Every setback is an opportunity. This resilience will make you more valuable. Trust me. 

Number four: Your job title is meaningless. 

The real value you bring to a company, is the work you do, not the label you hold. If you find this role has changed since you started. It might time to ask for a pay rise and a job title change. 

Number five: And finally, now I might get a lot of hate for this one. A bad team environment is your fault - fix your attitude. 

Yes, some companies are just toxic. But you get what you give. And if you come in negative, that will come straight back at you. 

Are you guilty of any of these?

It’s impactful. Personal. Controversial and perfect for short form. 

## Let’s try another one.

So the second type of linkedin post i see all the time, is a generic case study on another business in your niche. Again, these work great on short form. But you’ve got to be REALLY careful it doesn’t sound like an ad. 

A good example of a classic linkedin post here is: 

Cadbury's latest 'Made to Share' campaign is a MASTERCLASS in community-centric marketing.

Here’s why I love it👇🏽

Their redesigned Dairy Milk bar campaign hits every note perfectly - the packaging, the messaging, the thoughtfulness. It's heartwarming - and funny. 

The possibilities this opens for brand storytelling are extraordinary: What if we could maintain that same level of thoughtful design, that perfectly curated message, but extend it to other products and experiences? 

Not just limited-edition packaging, but true, life-like integrations that show appreciation for everyday acts in any context.

The real magic of this campaign isn't just about creating special packaging—it's about giving every customer an authentic reminder of how small acts of kindness make a big difference, all within the brand's curated world.

True appreciation, real connection, genuine warmth.

The future of branding isn't just about what we sell—it's about truly knowing how we can make people feel valued. And how consumers truly interact with your product. 

And I’m here for it 👏🏼

Again loads to unpack here. This is an interesting topic. And there is an interesting take. This one, I’m going to turn into a greenscreen, as it’s a very visual campaign. Which to me is what’s actually interesting about it. The different jokes on the packaging, the design, that’s all what MOST people will care about. So that should be the majority of the video. And then you slip in your marketing message while people are distracted by all the pretty colours. Just like before, the greenscren is the cheese, the marketing analysis is the pill. 

First let’s get into the wording. Now the use of the word masterclass on linkedin - great. On short form - hell no.  And community-centric marketing is just corporate jargon, and confusing. 

Cadbury’s new packaging is GENIUS [delivered as you point your hand up at the screen behind you], here’s what you can learn from it, as a marketing agency founder. 

This is better, as it’s simple (every can understand the word genius). The visual hook makes it clear what you’re going to talk about, there’s a clear implied payoff - you’re going to learn something. And there’s authority, as you describe who you are. Plus people are definitely distracted by the picture of chocolate on their screen. And you pointing at it, doubles this down. 

Then we want to launch into a story just talking about the images. 

So this campaign launched last month. And I love it so much. It’s basically all centred around the idea of sharing, the community around cadbury’s. 

Each bar has a different scenario that people would normally have a share bar in. And a little joke about who deserves more or less of it. 

![image.png](Repurposing%20from%20LinkedIn%20Worked%20Examples%2017ed642a7f718009b201e18ecb47f9c8/image.png)

So  who cooked, who cleaned and who ate. 
Who remembers everyones birthday, who sign the cards. 

Who keeps the group chat buzzing, who chips in and who leaves it on read (that last one is so me)
And my personal favourite: who presented the slides, who took notes, and who contributed a ‘cheers all at the end’ 

So we’re just talking through what it says. Not really adding any commentary, other than the occasional little joke. And rehooking with the ‘and my personal favourite’ as people are probably a little bored at this point. 

But you delivered on that, so time to rehook again. 

This is why I love it so much. 

Marketing isn’t about the brand anymore, it’s about the consumer. It’s about finding a reality, a dilemma, an experience that the consumer will have and placing your product into it. 

And sharing food, especially chocolate, is never fair. So them approaching this interaction, doubling down on it and making a joke - puts them INTO people’s experience with the product. It positions them as part of that moment between friends, family or strangers. And makes you feel more connected with the brand, without them having to say anything. 

I’d love to see which other campaigns follow up on this. 

Be honest, which square would you be?

So this reworked script, is not jargon heavy - at all. It’s concise, and mainly it focusses on what people ACTUALLY care about. The visuals will keep people distracted, there’s a reason to comment at the end, and it slips in some of your messaging and analysis right at the end. 

The reason it’s best to put it right at the end, is because frankly, a lot of people will scroll once they’ve seen all the pictures. And that’s fine, as long as you’ve kept them long enough that you’ve got a high watch time. Then the people that stay, will be interested, and could click through to your page as they appreciate the value. 

Now for the marketing experts watching, this rework of the ‘analysis’ IS very shallow. But we’re on short form - and in this context, that is actually a deep take. A little exeprtise goes a long way on these platforms - as most people are talking about absolutely NOTHING of value. Now in some videos you can talk more in depth about your expertise. But this video is talking about chocolate, so is a great one to send to as many people as possible. So keep it simple and concise and understandable. Even if its painful.

A little pro tip for this video too, is to get as many different relevant interesting images as possible. A greenscreen works if there’s constant change, so screenshot as much as you can about the campaign that looks good. And start with the most interesting one. 

Ok now the third type of linkedin post we’ll go through is the ‘I did this wacky thing, because I’m not like other founders post’ That every founder makes. And this is basically just you telling a cool story about something ‘risky’ you did. The wacky story with a deep resonant lesson.  LIke.

**I moved into my employee’s house for a week – here’s why.**

I believe in leading from the front.

So when one of my team members told me they were struggling with work-life balance, I didn’t just listen—I packed a bag and moved in.

For one week, I lived their routine. Woke up at their alarm. Sat at their desk. Took calls from their kitchen table. Watched how work blended into personal life in ways I’d never seen before.

And what I learned changed everything.

It wasn’t about time management. It wasn’t about productivity hacks.

It was about **mental load.**

- The pressure of back-to-back meetings with no time to think.
- The guilt of stepping away, even for lunch.
- The feeling that if they weren’t “always on,” they weren’t doing enough.

That week made me rethink everything about how we work.

So we made changes.

- **No more pointless meetings.** If it can be a message, it’s a message.
- **More async communication.** Not everything needs an instant reply.
- **Real flexibility.** If someone needs to step away at 2 PM to reset, they should.

Because when people have **space** to breathe, they don’t just work better.

They think better. They live better.

I’m not saying every leader should move in with their employees (I wouldn’t wish my snoring on anyone 😅).

But we **do** need to listen. To understand. To make real changes that actually help.

Because when your team thrives, your business thrives.

Would love to hear—what’s one workplace change that made a real difference in your life? Drop it below 👇🏼

Now again, you’ve got to be very careful of how you say this on short form. or people will dislike you for it. it’s an interesting point, but in video it could very easily be spun into a soundbite, and pull in some bad press, so deliver it chill. 

First. The hook is great. **I moved into my employee’s house for a week – here’s why.**This is something we can actually keep. I WANT to watch this video. 

But what’s missing from this linkedin post, is storytelling. It’s not painted a picture or set the scene. It just goes straight into the lesson. It’s also a bit too ‘me me me’. This is how I’d fix that. 

3e2

“I moved into my employee’s house for a week — here’s why.”

So this employee, who is also incidentally my best friend, was struggling with burnout. He works incredibly hard, much harder than me. We’d tried to optimise his workflow to make things easier - but honestly just couldn’t find the bottleneck.

So I decided to live his routine with him - of course at his request. 

The first day was a bit weird. Especially as a founder with a very strict routine. But for a full week, I woke up to his alarm, worked at his kitchen table, juggled back-to-back calls—just like he did.

And guess what I learned?

Working from home has actually ruined work life balance. The burn out wasn’t from workload, it was feeling pressured to always be ‘on,’ never daring to step away from the desk - not even for lunch.

And I realised I had to adapt the company to fix it. So I made these three changes. 

1. I  killed pointless meetings - if it can be a quick message, it’s a message.
2. I embraced asynchronous comms - no more expecting instant replies.

3.	And 3, I embraced REAL flexibility. if you need an hour at 2 PM to reset, take it. The team will manage. 

Would you ever let your boss move in with you for a week?

So this works, as it opens with that same punchy hook (I love it it sounds insane). But then immediately softens it so people don’t hate you — if it’s your best friend that sounds a lot better. 

Then it’s rewriteen to sound actually like a story, not a lecture. Setting the scene, and the emotional context. It immerses people and they want to find out what happens. They start to relate to this ‘best friend/ employee character’. But that hook of ‘moving in’ is still enough to keep them going. 

Then it has a concise solution. And I’ve coupled it with format remixing, chucking in a listlcle last minute to KEEP people there. 

And then I’ve finished it all off with a playful question to spark comments. 

It’s controversial, it’s authentic, it’s valuable, and it’s refreshing - without feeling braggy and insufferable (like that original linekdin post does) and it’s no longer boring corporate or confusing. 

So three linkedin posts,  three very different types of script, that I think will all perform VERY well on short form - no extra research or learning required.
