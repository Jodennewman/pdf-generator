This module is all about what I like to call, the **Founder’s Paradox**:

So you’re busy, but you want to make content, so you’ve hired a team of professional creatives to handle it—who you’ve probably also put on this course. Now if you’ve done this, you’re probably planning to batch it all to save time, to get your team to script, film and edit everything - and you’ll film twice a month in the studio - great.

But. Short-form platforms are based on lo-fi, personal, and authentic content. So how do they work together?

How do you film spontaneous authentic content, in a ‘contrived’ setting? 

The core of it: less is more. 

A lot of founders, who are new to content, fall into the pitfall of ‘all the gear, and no idea”. They have big budgets, bigger than the usual influencer, but not much knowledge on video production. So they go all-in on fancy cameras, editors, and professional studio lighting. 

But - it’s not done quite right. 

I’ve seen people using the best cameras on the market, only to end up with weird color grading and poorly done lighting that doesn’t look natural. It feels off to the viewer - especialy when they’re used to iphone camera filming.  

Now I’m not saying you can’t use good equipment. You can go ‘hi-fi’ but you’ve got to get the balance and the skill right, so it’s almost unnoticeable. The key is for all that hi-fi to to be FELT not SEEN. 

A good way to think of all this — and bear with me — is to imagine short form platforms as McDonald’s. Everyone in there is hungry for a simple burger and chips meal. 

If you come in and try and serve them a ten patty, dry aged wagyu burger with gold leaf and caviar - they probably won’t want it. They’re in maccies for a reason. What you want to serve them instead, is something that looks like a McDonalds - but more like the ones in the ads that in real life - its the same but better - and it tastes the same - but MORE delicious. It’s looks the same, but it FEELS better. 

So how do you acheive that? 

Well the first step is finding the right talent. Many creatives can light a studio for a professional shoot, direct big productions, or edit film trailers with insane visual effects. 

But the creatives you need for short form - can do all of that but pare it back. The talent for these platforms is restraint, knowing what’s FELT but not SEEN. 

The second, step, is still, despite the fancy setup, still going back to basics and using everyone’s favourite formats. 
Like the green screen. Instead of the built-in TikTok green screen feature your editor can mask you out and put you onto a greenscreen in post. 

All of these formats are still in your wheelhouse, and give the same effect of lo-fi authenticity - but better. 

The third part is batching. Basically filming all your content for the next few weeks/ month in the same day. Now all influencers do this. Cooking influencers will film 10 cooking videos at once. Makeup influencers will sit down for 12 hours and take their make up on and off continually, until they’ve got a WHOLE bunch of filming. This is normal - you’re not being fake.  
The key to batching ‘authentically’ is just to make it look like it wasn’t all filmed in one go. So change up your tshirt, your hair, and maybe even a little bit of the staging.

By the way, whilst we’re on the topic of clothing - keep it casual. No suits or formal wear - please. Just what you wear day to day. 

But overall. While all of these factors are key, the BIGGEST difference will come with a creative team that KNOWS the platform, knows what they’re trying to replicate, and can tone it down and replicate it accordingly - and get it all done RIGHT. 

So yes, it’s okay to have clean lighting, a solid camera, tight editing - it just needs to be **felt**, not **seen**. 

Short-form users just want to see *you.*

    This module is all about what I like to call, the **Founder’s Paradox**: 
    
    So ou’re busy,  but you want to make content, so you’ve hired a team of proffesional creatives to handle it - who are probably also on this course. And if you’ve done this then you’re probably planning to batch it all, script and film in a studio - great. 
    
    But. Short-form platform are based on **lo-fi, personal, and authentic** content. So how do they work together? 
    
    **“Less Is More” and the Fast-Food Analogy**
    
    Think of short-form as **fast food**: cheap, fast, a little messy—but delicious in its own way. Now, that doesn’t mean your content has to look sloppy. You can still make a **better, tastier burger**—something that looks casual but also has great ingredients. That’s where a hint of high production can come in, as long as it doesn’t scream “corporate commercial.”
    
    **Less** is often **more**: Instead of layering fancy transitions or overdoing the color grading, keep things clean and bright. If it feels too “manufactured,” short-form watchers will tune out. They want an immediate sense of “Oh, this is just a real person talking to me,” even if you spent hours behind the scenes making it happen.
    
    **The Pitfall of “All the Gear, No Idea”**
    
    A lot of businesses with big budgets buy fancy cameras, hire multiple editors, and rent professional sets. Then they end up with videos that look like they belong on TV—overly scripted, stiff, and totally disconnected from the easygoing short-form culture.
    
    People on TikTok or Reels scroll right past anything that feels **too** polished. It’s like you’re serving them lobster and caviar when they actually came for a quick burger. They love something casual and instantly appealing, so if you’re dishing out a formal, five-star entrée, they may not even give it a chance.
    
    Be careful not to go overboard with gear if you don’t know how to use it tastefully. I’ve seen people buy top-of-the-line cameras only to end up with weird color grading and glaring lights that look more sci-fi than social media. If something feels off to the viewer (like bizarre lighting or that *too-perfect* aesthetic), they’ll swipe away.
    
    Plus, never assume success on LinkedIn = success on TikTok or Reels. People on LinkedIn might be polite or supportive because they know you; short-form audiences are ruthless. If it’s boring or feels forced, they’re gone in 0.5 seconds.
    
    **“Elevated Green Screen” & Faux Lo-Fi**
    
    Let’s talk **practical strategies**. One of my favorites is the “Elevated Green Screen.” Instead of using TikTok’s built-in green screen effect, you can film in a proper setup with good lighting, then mask yourself out in After Effects, CapCut, or Descript. It looks like the same casual “person in front of a screenshot” style that everyone loves, but it’s crisp and glitch-free.
    
    Similarly, you can run a **teleprompter** or read a fully scripted piece—just make sure you deliver it in a way that feels natural. Throw in a quick “um” or “like,” watch your eye movement, and **never** sound like a robot. The best short-form feels like an off-the-cuff convo, even when it’s meticulously planned.
    
    **Dress Like a Real Person & Keep the Set Personal**
    
    Unless you literally wear suits every day, consider dressing how you normally do. T-shirts, hoodies—whatever feels real. Throw a plant or a coffee mug in the background. Use your actual home office or set it up to *look* like one. The point is to break that “sterile studio” look that screams, “I’m trying too hard.”
    
    **Batching Content (But Keeping the Illusion)**
    
    If you’re busy (and most founders are), you’ll likely want to **batch** your filming. That’s totally fine, even if it means you’re pretending each video is on a different day. Just swap shirts, move the camera angle a bit, and keep your energy fresh. Short-form watchers don’t mind if each piece has the same background; they just want to *feel* like you’re showing up regularly with fresh thoughts.
    
    **Fake Authenticity (Hint: It’s Fine)**
    
    Some founders worry about “faking authenticity.” But, honestly, *everyone* does it to some extent. Influencers batch their content, change outfits, pretend it’s multiple days—whatever fits their schedule. As long as it’s still **you**—your real voice, your actual ideas—it’s not malicious.
    
    The goal is to replicate that “I just hopped on my phone and shared a quick thought” vibe, even if you spent hours scripting and lighting it perfectly. So, let yourself stage certain things, like setting up a cozy corner of your home office or using a snippet from a planned speech. That’s normal in short-form.
    
    **The Real Key: Hooking Strangers**
    
    The biggest challenge for a founder or business owner is hooking people who *don’t* know you. Established creators can post anything, and it’ll probably do okay, because fans recognize them. You don’t have that luxury—especially if you’re just starting out. So your content needs an immediate, attention-grabbing hook, a relevant message, and a personal feel. No existing fan base means you have to win them over in the first few seconds, purely on content alone.
    
    **Final Thoughts**
    
    The Founder’s Paradox is real: **How do you look professional without losing that raw, personal spark?** The answer is a careful blend of *true authenticity* with a touch of strategic staging. Let your professional edge **enhance** your short-form vibe, not smother it.
    
    Remember, you can still have top-tier production quality—clean lighting, a good camera, smooth editing—just let it be **felt**, not **seen**. Keep the spontaneity that short-form audiences love. Talk directly to the camera like you’re calling a friend, not filming a primetime commercial. That’s how you’ll build real trust and connection, even if you’re aiming to be the next big founder with a polished brand.
    
    *So go ahead—batch your content, plan your shots, but never forget:* short-form is about real people wanting to watch **real** stuff. Embrace that, and you’ll crack the Founder’s Paradox in no time.
    
    - 
        
        If you’re building a brand or business (and you’re on this course) your videos will probably involve scripting, a studio setup, polished editing, and a professional camera. So how do you inject that raw, personal appeal into something that’s meticulously planned?
        
        This is the **founder paradox**: You need a certain level of polish to convey authority and credibility—and yet you must also capture that “real person” essence that resonates with short-form audiences.
        
        You need to replicate ‘Lo-Fi’. 
        
        Ultimately, the platform you’re on, has audiences who LOVE that love traditional, low-key influencer content. They’re in McDonald’s and you’re trying to serve them lobster and caviar. Maybe it’s ‘technically better’ but if that’s not what they’re hungry for - they won’t eat it. 
        
        What you should be trying to do instead is serve them a better, tastier, and prettier McDonald’s burger, that’s indistinguishable but just feels nicer. You have to give them what they want - but elevate it. 
        
        To butcher the analogy, you have to learn how to fake authenticity. 
        
        Here’s a few tips on how to do that: 
        
        First. The elevated greenscreen. 
        A staple of tiktok, is the greenscreen. It’s an easy way for anyone, with no editing experience, to make a visually interesting video - with lots of pictures, articles, links, visual pacifiers. It feels deeply authentic and natural. 
        
        To do this yourself - but better - you can film in the studio, and edit yourself onto an image in adobe aftereffects to make it look like you’re in a greenscreen. So the lighting is high quality, the camera footage is high quality, and the greenscreen isn’t gltiching. 
        
        It’s a little better - AND - it makes you feel more relatable, ‘lo-fi’ and authetnci, without having to film it on your phone. 
        It’s greenscreen, but elevated. 
        
        Second. The natural script. 
        
        We of course cover the importance of being natural in the script, but this is especially important here. Presenting in a casual normal voice, throwing in the word ‘like’ and ‘um’ and ‘ah’ will give the impression you’re speaking off the cuff, even if you’re not. 
        
        Third. The casual wardrobe choices. 
        
        Even if you’re filming in a studio, dress like you normally would day to day. No suits. No fancy dresses. Just a t-shirt, or casual outfit will position you as someone who’s just filming this casually. People really won’t realise. 
        
        And when setting up your studio (we talk about this a lot in the studio setup module) add in some props. A coffee cup, some paper in the background, a picture on the wall, a plant. Make it look a little like your home office. Or, literally set your studio up in your home office, so that it feels like you’e just run in to film it. 
        
        Ultimately. The core of making good lo-fi content, is having a respect for the platform, and EVERY type of content on there. 
        
        It might feel counterintuitive to look at makeup tutorials, “get ready with me” videos, or casual car rants for inspiration when you want to be the next Stephen Bartlett. But the more you respect and adapt to that culture, the more effectively you’ll tap into the emotional core that drives their success.
        
        Short-form “lo-fi” style isn’t about sacrificing professionalism or lowering production quality. It’s about **capturing the genuine, immediate connection** that compels people to stop scrolling and start listening. 
        
        And not doing too much. 
        
        A pitfall a lot of founders, who business with big budgets do, is try too hard. It’s highly scripted, highly edited, highly produced, and really this is the antithesis of how to make your strategy work. 
        
        If you want to improve your content, don’t do more - do less. 
        
        Let’s talk about **The Founder’s Paradox.** 
        
        You’ve watched this course and are at the point where you realise you need a certain level of polish to convey authority and credibility in your videos—and yet you must also capture that “real person” vibe that resonates in short-form.
        
        That’s the big challenge: how do you balance **looking professional** with **feeling authentic**?
        
        **The Pitfalls of “All the Gear and No Idea”**
        
        A pitfall a lot of founders (or businesses with big budgets) stumble into is **overproduction**. They’ve got fancy cameras, a huge studio, maybe even a professional editing team. But their content ends up feeling stiff, scripted, and kind of out of touch with the short-form culture.
        
        Think about it: if you’re on TikTok or Instagram Reels, you scroll through tons of quick, off-the-cuff videos—people chatting in their car, filming in their messy bedroom, or literally ranting while walking down the street. That’s **normal** content for these platforms.
        
        So when a user sees an overly produced, highly polished video, they might keep scrolling. It’s like handing someone a high-end steak dinner when they were expecting (and craving) a quick burger.
        
        **Keeping It Simple—and Relatable**
        
        What if you just did it **simply** instead? Instead of throwing every fancy editing technique at the screen, aim to capture a **vibe** that’s polished but still relaxed. You can still use good cameras and lighting—just dial back on the perfection so it doesn’t feel forced.
        
        **Remember**: The key is to replicate lo-fi authenticity, even if you have a big budget. Instead of building a massive set, use a small studio corner that looks like a home office. Or literally just film at home. Talk to the camera like it’s a friend, not an auditorium full of strangers.
        
        **Batching Content with a Team**
        
        Now, let’s talk about **batching**. If you’re a busy founder or business owner, the best way to stay consistent is to block off a chunk of time—maybe once a month—and film multiple pieces of content all at once.
        
        •	It saves time.
        
        •	It makes your content more cohesive.
        
        •	It keeps you from burning out trying to film *every* single day.
        
        Having a small team can help, too. One person checks audio, another handles lighting, someone else keeps an eye on the script. But remember: **don’t overdo it**. You want to keep that lo-fi, spontaneous energy—so even if you have five people in the studio, keep the vibe casual.
        
        **Replicating Off-the-Cuff With High Production**
        
        Sometimes, you do want that high-end feel. Maybe you’re presenting big ideas or launching something important. You can still look professional *and* off-the-cuff:
        
        1.	**Use a High-Quality Camera** but still frame it like a selfie video—slightly closer, more intimate.
        
        2.	**Edit in a Greenscreen** effect like we talked about, but do it in a way that mimics a quick TikTok, just minus the glitchy edges.
        
        3.	**Write a Script**, but pepper in some “ums,” stumbles, or side comments to make it sound unrehearsed.
        
        The trick is to give people that sense of a **real human** on the other end of the screen—even if the lights, camera, and microphone are top-notch.
        
        **The Bottom Line**
        
        If you want to be effective on short-form platforms, you can’t ignore the **lo-fi culture**. You can’t just rely on professional polish alone. People crave authenticity, relatability, and a sense of **spontaneity**.
        
        Yes, **polish** can convey credibility. But when your videos feel too staged, you lose that spark that makes TikTok or Reels so addicting.
        
        **Sometimes, the best move is to strip it back.** Show up as you are, script lightly, keep things fun, and hit record. By doing that, you’ll stand out as a founder who “gets it”: someone who respects the platform’s culture but still delivers high-value, professional content.
