In this module, we’ll cover the essential building blocks of establishing credibility in any online space—from presenting yourself professionally to engaging with your audience in a way that fosters real trust. If you’re just starting to think about authority-building, this session gives you the universal toolkit you’ll need, no matter which platforms you’re on.

Online you can find endless accounts of people who provide an expertise in any subject you’d like be it cookery, business, training or gaming. 

Through large followings and viral content these people have gained an authority figure status. They then are able to drive growth for brands as they’re able to align them selves with trusted and worthwhile partners. 

How do you gain the authority? 

There’s 6 key ways to do it. 

Firstly, you want to begin Establishing Credibility. 

Make sure that within your videos you share your relevant experience and qualifications authentically. It can be as simple as a tag line people recognise in your videos such as “I’m X and I’m a XYZ specialising in ABC”

Within your feed you should back up claims with concrete examples and data. If you have case studies or unique stories, use them in your content and if that video performs, don’t be afraid of rehashing those points a few more times. Another thing to employ here is humility, be transparent about your learning journey and don’t be afraid to admit when you don't know something to your audience because this honesty builds trust with them. 

No one believes the person that says they know everything about everything without any evidence. You need to provide evidence to you audience but remind them that you’re human and learning too, that’s where a good audience connection comes from. 

Secondly, Professional Presentation

These are all things we’ve spoken about in our practical lessons but as as reminder the key points are:

- Maintain good lighting and clear audio quality
- Use confident but natural body language
- Don’t over edit your videos, when you’re building trust simple messaging is easier to digest. (maybe compare MR BEAST and Diary of a Leo and how they are perceived publicly here)

Thirdly, structure your content to maximise the learning for your audience. Start with a strong hook that demonstrates that the audience is about to watch something of value. [insert example]. When organising your information do it logically in an A+B=C format.

Use examples and stories to illustrate points and end with actionable takeaways. 

Fourthly, Let's talk about communication skills - these are absolutely crucial for building authority in your content. When you're speaking to camera, imagine you're having a friendly chat with someone you respect. Keep your speech clear and steady, not too fast or slow, just like you're explaining something interesting to a friend. Your tone should be confident (you know your stuff!) but stay approachable and warm - no one likes being talked down to. Watch out for those pesky "ums" and "ahs" that can creep into your speech - they can make you seem less sure of yourself. And here's a simple but powerful tip: maintain good eye contact with the camera lens. Think of it as looking directly at your viewer, building that personal connection. When you nail these communication basics, your audience will naturally view you as someone who knows what they're talking about.

Fifthly, let's dive into engagement - it's not just about posting content, it's about creating real connections! Think of your comment section as a cozy coffee shop where you're having great conversations with friends. When someone takes the time to leave a comment, respond thoughtfully - show them you really care about what they have to say. Ask questions back, share your thoughts, and keep the conversation flowing naturally. It's amazing how a simple "Thanks for sharing your experience!" can make someone's day and encourage them to stick around. The goal is to create this wonderful community vibe where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and experiences. Remember, your most engaged followers are like your online family - they'll be your biggest supporters and help spread the word about your content. So take the time to nurture these relationships, celebrate your community's wins, and create an inclusive space where everyone feels valued.

Finally, let's talk about the secret sauce of building authority online - consistency! It’s like being that reliable friend everyone counts on. Just like you wouldn't ghost a friend, don't disappear on your audience! Try to pick a posting schedule that works for you and stick to it, whether it's daily, three times a week, or whatever feels manageable. But here's the thing - it's not just about showing up regularly. Your content should feel like it's coming from the same person every time. Keep your message and values steady, like your own personal North Star guiding everything you do. Develop a style that's uniquely you - maybe it's your intro catchphrase, your editing style, or even just the way you explain things. And super important: if you tell your audience you're going to do something, make it happen! Whether it's promising a follow-up video or announcing a special project, following through builds trust like nothing else. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is online authority - it's built brick by brick, post by post, keeping those promises one at a time.

True authority comes from consistently delivering value and building genuine connections with your audience over time. Focus on serving your viewers rather than just appearing authoritative. If you want to be seen as an authority figure that can teach your audience something, treat them how a good teacher treats their students, as equals.
