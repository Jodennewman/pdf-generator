# Essential Tips for Solo Phone Filming

## Setup

- **Clean your lens:** The number of times I've gone to film something on my phone and it’s just a greasy horrible finger smudge. Don’t make that mistake. Wipe your phone's camera lens before filming. Sounds obvious but I’m telling you, we’ve all forgotten it and regretted it!
- **Stabilization:** Now this depends on the style of your videos. Handheld front camera filming is absolutely used by tonnes of people. The shakiness almost adds to the authenticity. but if that’s not for you, you can use a phone tripod or prop your phone against a stable object.
- **Lighting setup:** This is a crime I see far too many people committing! You should always film facing your light sources. Don’t have them behind you otherwise the audience won't be able to see you! Failing a natural light source, ring lights do the trick in a basic setup. but I would recommend investing in a small LED panel light with a few simple controls.
- **Background check:** Try to choose clean, uncluttered backgrounds that won't distract from your content… but also, try to avoid single tone boring backgrounds because they don’t exactly capture the eye. It’s a bit of a process to find what works but over time you’ll develop a bit of a design eye for it. Just start with something plain, and gradually tweak it per video until you land on something that you a. Like and B. boosts video performance.

## Technical Settings

Now the boring bit of filming is making sure you’re filming the right way, because there’s nothing worse then pulling your footage into an editor and it’s all dark and grainy. 

You should film in 4K if your phone supports it but at the minimum, film in 1080p. You might think you can get away with slightly lower quality but in today's world, you really need to be HD at the minimum. It’s not even just for aesthetics, HQ videos perform better! (and they also mean you can earn more once monetisation kicks in)

Now for FPS which stands for frames per second, you can use 24fps for a cinematic look or 60fps for smooth motion. People are more used to watching things that are 24fps but if you’re filming some really high quality product shots, 60fps might be the choice. 

Enable the camera grid to help with composition and framing and make sure you tap and hold on your subject to lock your focus.

## Audio Tips

Now with audio, you just want to make sure you film in quiet spaces with minimal background noise, try to listen out for echo. If you’re in a big empty space, that echo is going to be huge and unless that’s the point, it just makes your videos feel unthought through. 

Now generally your phone mice is fine but for that extra bit of production quality you can consider a small lavalier mic that connects to your phone via Bluetooth. They’re available everywhere and they’re super easy to set up and use. I’d recommend these ones: 8888 

## Composition Guidelines

The reason you want that grid switched on is to help you compose your shots. There’s a basic filming principal called the rule of thirds which almost all professional camera type people will know about and use every time they film anything. The basics to that are:

Place key subjects at the intersection points of your grid line.

Make sure you position the camera with the top horizontal line at eye level, it’s generally a pretty good guide for how to make your final edit feel like it’s giving eye contact to the viewer and also, it should leave appropriate space above the subject's head, nothing worse than cutting off the top of someones head!

and also, If you’re not facing the camera, face across the shot. If you're looking off to the right, place your self on the left sided line. Other wise you’re talking off camera and it simply just looks odd. 

## Self-Recording Techniques

- **Front camera:** Use your front camera's mirror mode to check your framing
- **Multiple takes:** Don’t be afraid of recording several versions to have options whilst editing
- Say your lines a few times before hitting record, get yourself ready to go.
- If a word is tripping you up over and over, skip it and try to film it at the end instead. Remember, that’s what editing is for.

## Post-Production

- **Mobile editing**

TikTok's built-in editor is actually really straightforward to use. 

**Basic trimming:** After recording or uploading your video, use the trim handles at the bottom of the screen to cut unwanted parts from the start or end

**Split clips:** Tap the 'Split' button where you want to cut your video into separate segments

**Adjust clips:** You can drag and drop clips to reorder them, or tap a clip to adjust its duration

**Add effects:** Use the Effects button to add transitions, filters, and visual effects to your clips

**Sound editing:** Tap 'Volume' to adjust the sound levels of your original video and any added music

**Text and stickers:** Add text overlays and stickers by tapping the Text and Stickers buttons - you can set how long they appear on screen

Remember to preview your edits before posting to make sure everything flows smoothly!

All built in editing systems work the same. If you can learn tiktok’s, which is the most complex. You’ll understand YouTube and Instagram,  so just focus on TikTok. 

- Saving your footage

Now this might feel a bit too extra but there's nothing worse than trying to go back to find an old clip you need for something, and it being lost. 

So when it comes to saving your phone footage, it's crucial to have a reliable backup system. The simplest approach is to save your videos to cloud storage services like Google Drive, iCloud, or Dropbox immediately after filming. These services usually offer automatic backup features, so once you set them up, your videos will sync automatically.

For extra security, consider saving your videos to an external hard drive as well. This creates a local backup that you can access even without internet connection. Most external drives connect easily to your phone using a simple adapter, and you can drag and drop your files directly.

A good practice is to organize your videos into dated folders, making them easy to find later. Remember to regularly clear space on your phone by moving older videos to these backup locations, but only after confirming they've been successfully transferred.
