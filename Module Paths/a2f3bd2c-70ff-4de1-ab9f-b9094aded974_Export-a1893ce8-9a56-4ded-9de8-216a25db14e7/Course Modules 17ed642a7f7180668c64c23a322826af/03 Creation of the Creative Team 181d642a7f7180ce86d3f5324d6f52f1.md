The majority of top creators you see will have a team, and they tend to fill these roles:

- General Manager
- Writer
- Producer / Content Manager
- Videographer
- Editor
- Account Manager / Social Media Manager

that’s 6 different hats, but don’t worry. This module is about understanding what these fundamental roles do, and how to make sure your setup, no matter what size, delivers equally.

First there’s you, the entrepreneur/executive/C-E-”X”, the person with the brand, the vision, and the voice that inspires thousands of people. With a personal brand, you’re always on the team because of the three things you can never delegate. 1. Your message 2. Your lived experience , 3. your face.

But, if you’re ok with having to provide those at least those 3 things, then we can continue on.

**Writer**

Writing, research, and strategy tend to all fall together. It’s taking the vision, the voice, and the direction, and researching formats that could work, staying on top of latest industry trends you might want to talk about, and understand what grabs people about it, : hooks, retention and story telling.

**(video) Producer**

The producers job is to bring it all together - going between the creative and the practical, the producer makes sure the videos being made are on brand, high quality, and cutting edge.

The producer quickly becomes a vital role. They work with the writer on  ideation and strategy, and final sign-off – with the videographer on what to get and when to get it, with the editors on fine-tuning the thing that connects and trouble shooting when something isn’t right, and with you on . It’s ideal if they’re a bit of a swiss army knife as they will need to jump in and help different members of the team at any one time. 
They will have experience in ( or at least a deep understanding of) all key areas of the production pipeline, know how they fit together, and importantly, are a lifesaver when the unexpected occurs. 

**Videographer**

On one hand, a videographer’s job is simply to make sure you & the message you want to put out, is delivered in a flattering, clean, and interesting way.

However, In the context of content they are likely to also be a sound technician, a key grip, a colour scientist, and a director. Whether that’s in your home, on a set, or moving from place to place – The videographer is someone who knows how and when to get the best shot. 

**Video Editor**

The video-editors job is to take the raw videos you create and polish them up, set the pacing, keep them visually interesting, and most importantly, easy to understand. It’s a lot of work to stay on top of a daily workflow, so the editor you look for should have a creative eye and a strong work ethic.

Video editing can be the more labor intensive end of the pipeline, if we’re talking on a ‘per video’ basis, so this may be a role you want to fill more than once. Depending on the scope of your operation.

**Social Media Manager**

Fundamentally, each role is important, and dependent of the size, scope and ambitions of your project, you can add more roles, or boil them down to a few key people.

Whatever you choose to do, understanding the fundamental roles should help keep you covered when setting up an effective video personal brand.

**So a quick but very important aside: when to use AI, and when to stay the hell away from it:**

Naturally, with this many shoes to fill, it becomes very tempting to lean heavily on AI.

Do. It’s brilliant. But its not THAT brilliant.

Topline: Using AI is excellent, it makes your team sharper, faster, and more creative, but doesn’t replace them. 

Here are the dos and donts of using LLM’s to help you (as of February 2025)

**Ideation**

**Don’t – have it come up with original ‘TikTok ideas’**

It doesn’t understand the platform or what’s good about it. Short form video is sort of a ‘GPT-Blindspot’. It doesn’t know what’s good because it’s so new and fast-moving as a medium.

**Do - Use it to suggest variations or spin-offs on an existing idea.**

When you have something that’s working, a bucket that you like, then an LLM is great to suggest an infinite amount of ways you can take it. If you give it the concept to play with, then you can get some actually solid ideas.

**Writing scripts:**

Do: 

- use it for research (just double check its sources)
- Use it to analyse your audience

**Don’t – get it to write the scripts**

It doesnt know you, it doesnt know your audience and it (most importantly) hasn’t taken this course.

You may be able to train an LLM to make scripts, but you wont be able to do it without: thorough notes from you, labour intensive prompts, and a lot of brow beating.

We find its easier in the end to write the scripts ourselves and use chatgpt to help with flow and structure. 

**Don’t – Feed it your inspiration, and try to get an original script.**

If you’ve got pre-validated content you’re working from – great, that’s a smart thing to have – but LLMs, even the biggest and the best, struggle to separate and adapt text, it can’t tell what parts to change and what parts to say the exact same. You’ll spend hours prompting to “make it more original” before you get so flustered you do it yourself. 

**When editing videos:**

Don’t: 

use a service that chops up podcasts and think thats it. Your podcast is likely unoptimised, and the AI definitely is not optimised for socials. Using an AI not only takes the labour out of a human’s hands, it takes the experimentation/feedback loop out of a humans hands, meaning it rarely improves on the technical decisions it makes as it struggles to see detailed results

OUTRO

Ultimately, there’s one role I haven’t crossed off the list yet, and that’s the general manager.

With content being delivered daily across multiple platforms, a team of 5 or more, brand deals and the trials and tribulations that come with running what is now, an entire business, you will likely need to hire a general manager. 

A general manager is an entrepreneur who is responsible for hiring, firing, going in between you, your agent and your creative team to deliver an exceptional personal brand.

The general manager is the final hire, and is ultimately used to take the responsibilities of running this entire operation off your hands.

If you are an entrepreneur, and already run another business, a GM is a no brainer when it gets to this stage.
