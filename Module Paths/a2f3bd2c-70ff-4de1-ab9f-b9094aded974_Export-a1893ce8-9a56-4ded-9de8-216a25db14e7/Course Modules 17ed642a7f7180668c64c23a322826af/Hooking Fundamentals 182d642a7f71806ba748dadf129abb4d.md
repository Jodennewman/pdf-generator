Ok Hooks. Nailing the hook is the key to nailing a viral video. Even if you’ve made the best, most creative, most valuable video of all time, if your hook is bad no-one will watch it. 

**So what is a hook?**

Put simply, a hook is the first few seconds of your video that you use to capture attention.

On short platforms, the majority of viewers - even if you have a decent following - don’t know who you are yet. They’re seeing your face for the first time - this hook is their introduction to you. And sorry in general they won’t care about you. They need a reason to stay. And your hook gives them that reason. And a good hook will do this by immediately setting up **clarity,** **intrigue - and finally, authority.** 

**Clarity and Intrigue**

By intrigue. I mean setting up unanswered questions that give people a reason to stay to the very end of your video. 

Now a lot of you will be thinking that to be intriguing, is to be really vague and mysterious. But this is not a good hook. If you’re too vague, people will have no idea what you’re talking about, and move on to a different video. 

And this is where clarity comes in. In that short amount of time people **need** to understand what you’re talking about, or they’ll scroll.

As a general rule of thumb, the more questions your hook asks, the better it is. 

Let’s go through an example of how intrigue and clarity achieve that.

Think about this hook for a second - ‘Do you want to hear the craziest thing that ever happened to me?’ 

Now this hook is, ok, it clearly sets the stage for a story, promises some pay off. But what questions can you actually think of. Well there’s only really one, which is :what’s the craziest thing that happened to you?’

And that’s because it’s too vague. it’s setting up intrigue, without enough clarity to make people interested. So we need to add a little more information. 

Now what about this hook:

‘Did I ever tell you about the time I got locked up in a swiss prison for treason?’. 

There’s way more information, swiss, prison, treason. And that means there’s WAY more questions in the viewers mind. Off the top of the video I’m already asking myself. 

Why were you in Switzerland? why did you get locked up? For how long? what did you do? why treason? do Switzerland even have a royal family? 

I’ve got way more questions, because I’ve got more to work with. It’s the perfect balance of intriguing, but still clear. 

**Authority** 

The fourth and final aspect of a good hook, is authority. In general your video is going to way more strangers than followers, especially early on, so who the hell are you? 

This is an issue I see a lot with people who are popular on other platforms, like linkedin, when moving to short form. They’ll decide to make a video about their business regrets, and start it off with something like ‘If I had to go and start my business alll over again, here’s what I’d do’. It’s an interesting concept - but a terrible hook - because no one on there knows who they are. White coat syndrome on these platforms is real. 

To combat this, I like to use what I call the ‘insecure teenager’ hack. Imagine you’re a cringe 14 year old who’s just started going to the gym, and you need to make sure EVERYONE knows about it. You’ll slip it into conversation ‘nonchalantly’ in any way possible. You need to do the same thing with who you are. That doesn’t mean start your video away with ‘Hi I’m Joden’. Because that doesn’t ask any questions or provide any clarity about the video. 

Just remember to slip in who you are and what you do into the first third of the video. 

So we’ve written a good hook. The next thing to be mindful of is your delivery. 

Again this is you introducing yourself, and first impressions matter. Now some people think you’ve got to go high energy and jump in shouting. No. That will annoy people and they won’t watch your video. 

Other people think you should go low energy and relatable. No, people will think you’re boring, and won’t want to watch your video. 

My rule for delivery is simple. Imagine you’re in a group of your friends, and you’ve got a story to tell - but everyone’s already talking, so you’e got to grab their attention. What I’m guessing you do, is raise your energy a little to speak over everyone. It’s still you, but. with maybe 20% extra. And then once you’ve grabbed everyone’s attention, you just keep on speaking as you normally would. 

That is exactly how you should deliver a hook on short form. Like you’re trying to grab your friends attention, with a little more energy, so they want to keep listening. 

So what we’ve mainly been focussing on here is the verbal hook. What you say at the start of the video. but there’s a couple other elements of the hook that you should pay attention. 

One of them is the text hook - what’s written on screen at the begining. 

Now this one is often very overlooked, but also makes a HUGE difference. People often read the text hook before they listen to what you’re saying (especially if they’re watching short form on mute - which a surprising amount of people do - especially on instagram). In general your text hook should ADD something to your verbal hook. Be that more context (for clarity) or more intrigue (a sign that something else is coming later) but in general i think text hooks are best to add more context, and more clairty, so you can use your verbal hook for the fun stuff. 

The second thing is the visual hook. This isn’t as important as the other two, but is still important to know about. Many videos manage on just a verbal and a text hook alone. But a visual hook is a signifier of a visual payoff that doesn’t require words. Think a guy holding a basketball in front of the screen, with a hoop in the background. It’s pretty clear he is going to throw it into the hoop at some point in the video. And this is enough for people keep watching. Introducing some kind of prop, or promised pay off visually, is a great way to keep people hooked. 

So overall. We want the hook to make it obvious what the video is about, open as many questions as possible in the readers mind, and set up why they should be listening to YOU. And you can do this through the text, what you’re saying, and what’s on the screen.

**Sub-Module 1: Introduction & Why Hooks Matter**

Ok Hooks. Nailing the hook is the key to nailing a viral video. Even if you’ve made the best, most creative, most valuable video of all time, if your hook is bad no-one will watch it.

So what is a hook? Put simply, a hook is the first few seconds of your video that you use to capture attention.

Hooks are nothing new. They’ve existed for as long as people have wanted to direct the attention of others toward something, nothing more than manipulating intrigue. You can see examples of hooks in every medium right up to short-form video—books, television, film trailers, billboards, newspapers, even philosophical essays. Every single piece of media throughout history has had to stand out from the swath of media that surrounds it. On a bookshelf, you look at the book with the most interesting title. You watch the film that had a really captivating trailer. You read the article that had the best headline. Without a hook, your content is nothing; it doesn’t exist.

If a piece of content falls in the woods, and no one is around to watch it, did it even get posted?

There’s a famous quote by ‘The Father of Advertising,’ David Ogilvy: “On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.” Another good quote by Ogilvy also puts it succinctly: “you cannot bore people into buying your product; you can only interest them in buying it.”

[**SUGGESTION**: “Keep that in mind: your hook is the part of your content that nearly everyone sees—so make it as compelling as possible.”]

On short platforms, the majority of viewers—even if you have a decent following—don’t know who you are yet. They’re seeing your face for the first time—this hook is their introduction to you. And sorry, in general they won’t care about you. They need a reason to stay. And your hook gives them that reason. A good hook will do this by immediately setting up intrigue, clarity—and finally, authority.

**Sub-Module 2: Clarity & Intrigue**

Clarity and intrigue go hand in hand. By intrigue, I mean setting up unanswered questions that give people a reason to stay to the very end of your video. Now a lot of you will be thinking that to be intriguing, you must be really vague and mysterious. But this is not a good hook. If you’re too vague, people will have no idea what you’re talking about, and move on to a different video. This is where clarity comes in. In that short amount of time, people need to understand what you’re talking about, or they’ll scroll.

As a general rule of thumb, the more questions your hook asks, the better it is. This relates closely to the Zeigarnik effect, which suggests people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. If your hook plants half a dozen questions in someone’s mind, they’ll stick around just to get closure.

Think about this hook for a second: “Do you want to hear the craziest thing that ever happened to me?” It clearly sets the stage for a story, promises payoff—but it only really asks one question: “What’s the craziest thing that happened to you?” And that’s because it’s too vague. So let’s add more information: “Did I ever tell you about the time I got locked up in a Swiss prison for treason?” Suddenly there’s way more detail—Swiss, prison, treason—raising a bunch of questions. Off the top of the video I’m already asking: Why were you in Switzerland? Why did you get locked up? For how long? What did you do? Why treason?

It’s the perfect balance of intriguing but still clear. Old pitfalls include question hooks that are too random (“How did Tupperware become so popular?”) or purely clickbaity (“Number 4 will shock you”). These days, people see right through that. Real intrigue means giving enough details up front to spark genuine curiosity.

**Sub-Module 3: Authority**

Authority is also critical. In general, your video is reaching way more strangers than followers, especially early on, so who the hell are you? A lot of people on other platforms come over to short form with a decent following and start a video with something like “If I had to go back and start my business all over again, here’s what I’d do.” That’s interesting, but also a terrible hook—because no one on short form knows who they are. You have to slip in your credentials or your angle early.

I like to call it the “insecure teenager” hack. Imagine you’re a cringe 14-year-old who’s just started going to the gym, and you need to make sure EVERYONE knows about it, so you slip it into conversation “nonchalantly.” That’s what you do with your authority. It doesn’t mean you have to start every video with “Hi, I’m Joden,” but slip in who you are and why you’re worth listening to by the time the viewer’s fully engaged.

**Sub-Module 4: Delivery**

So we’ve written a good hook. The next thing to be mindful of is your delivery. Again, this is you introducing yourself, and first impressions matter. Now some people think you’ve got to go high-energy and jump in shouting. No, that just annoys people. Others think you should be ultra-low-energy. Nope, they’ll think you’re boring.

My rule for delivery is simple: imagine you’re in a group of friends, and you’ve got a story to tell—but everyone’s already talking, so you raise your energy a little to grab their attention. It’s still you, just with maybe 20% extra. Then once you’ve got everyone’s attention, you speak normally. That’s how you should deliver a hook on short form.

Your energy is so important in a hook. You’re trying to invite an audience IN, not scare them away. Lots of people sound like they’re reading a script, but that’s no excuse to sound like it. A huge mistake some creators make is to simply start shouting. It’s forced hype, and it annoys people. Energy doesn’t mean more—it means natural. Practice speaking to the camera like it’s a friend.

This ties into the 55/38/7 rule of communication: 55% of how much people like you is determined by non-verbal cues (body language, facial expressions), 38% by your vocal tone and only 7% by your words. That’s why your delivery and visual presentation matter so much.

**Sub-Module 5: Text & Visual Hooks**

So, verbally, we’ve got a good hook. But there’s also your text hook and your visual hook to consider. A text hook is what you write on screen at the beginning. People might read that before they hear you talk, especially if they watch on mute. In general, it should either add more clarity or add more intrigue—don’t just repeat your verbal hook. Think of it like a road sign. You want people to grasp it instantly: bold, simple, high contrast, easy to read. If it’s too wordy or repeats what you’re already saying, you lose time and interest.

Then there’s the visual hook—some image that implies a payoff. Think of a guy holding a basketball in front of the screen with a hoop behind him. Immediately we know he’s going to shoot at some point, and we might stick around to see if he sinks it. Sometimes, you can use what’s called a visual disruption: something weird, shocking, or intriguing as your very first shot, to make people stop scrolling out of pure surprise. Or you can pacify them visually with something that changes every few seconds so they don’t get bored, like a side-by-side demonstration or a quickly changing set of images. All these keep people watching long enough to hear your entire message.

**Sub-Module 6: Final Thoughts**

Overall, we want the hook to make it obvious what the video is about, open as many questions as possible in the viewer’s mind, and set up why they should be listening to YOU. You do this through clarity, intrigue, authority, and a delivery that feels natural but confident. Your body language and facial performance are also crucial; you want warm, inviting posture and comfortable eye contact. Let yourself look away sometimes—locking your eyes on the camera the entire time can be creepy. And remember, with short-form video, your viewer is more “watching” than “listening.” That means your environment, your energy, your gestures, and your on-screen text are often more influential than your exact words.

[**SUGGESTION**: “Finally, remember David Ogilvy’s point: once you’ve created your hook, you’ve spent eighty cents out of your dollar. Make sure it’s worth it.”]
