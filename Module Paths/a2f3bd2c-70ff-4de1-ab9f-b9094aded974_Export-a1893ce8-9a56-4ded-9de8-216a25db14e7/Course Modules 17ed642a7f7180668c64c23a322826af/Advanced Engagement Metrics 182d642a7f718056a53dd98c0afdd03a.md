Ok so in the last engagement video we talked about the main metrics to watch: likes, saves, shares, comments, and retention, what each of them are and how to optimise for them. 

In this section, we’re going to take it a step further and move on to a few more advanced metrics that can if you can understand and harness, will really push your videos into viral territory. Sepcifcially we’re going to cover follower conversion, percentage completed watch, demographics, and traffic sources. 

Let’s get straight into it. 

So the first advanced metric is: follower conversion. This just means how many people actually followed you, from that particular video. You can see the raw numbers in your analytics, but it’s better to look at it as a percentage of viewers. So you can see how converting it was, comparatively, to another video. 

Now a high follower conversion rate basically tells you that your content is valuable, enjoyable, and recognisable. 

Now it’s not necessarily a sign of how much someone enjoys your content. The thing about followers, is they typically don’t come from the first video they’ve seen from you. I don’t know about you but there are maybe 20 creators I see on my for you page, that I watch religiously, but don’t follow yet. 

The way to get these people to follow, and to boost this conversion, is through a CTA - a call to action - bascially asking people to follow you. Now we cover optimisng for the CTA in the script mastery section. But in general you want to put this around 80-90% of the way into your video. If you leave it right to the end, most people have already scrolled away and will definitely scroll if you start asking for followers. 

If you do it when they’re still watching and clearly interested, right after a good rehook, you stand a better chance of getting that follow. 

I’ve personally seen this make a massive difference between a video doing decently at 100k views or absolutely blowing up to a million or even ten million. So it’s worth adding a quick follow prompt into your script.

The next advanced metric to look at is percentage completed watch time. This is basically looking at the percentage of people who watched right through to the end. So yes it’s closely tied to retention. But the algorithm massively favours videos that get a full completed view - especially if the video is longer - so this is definitely worth optimising for. 

Again we’ll cover optimising for this in detail in the script mastery section. But the way to optimise for this metric, is to cut ANY fluff at the end of the video. Whether that’s a sale, conclusion, or just dead air. Tightentng up your script so that there’s no time wasted at the end will make a huge difference to this number. 

Of course we can also optimise by making the video shorter. This works GREAT on instagram. But not so good on TikTok. Instagram are happy for you to do a quick short skit, or 5 second video post. TikTok howeer prefer longer videos on average, so if you can hit that sweet spot of over a minute + high completion - you’re golden. 

The next important metric to look at, is demographics. So all short form platforms give you a breakdown of where your viewers are from, their age range, and their gender.

This is super useful because it tells you who you’re actually reaching — and it might not always be who you think. If you’re trying to appeal to a younger audience but most of your views are coming from people in their 30s, you might need to change up your references or your posting times. 

It also helps to know which regions your viewers are in so you can schedule your uploads when they’re actually awake. For example, if you notice a lot of engagement from Australia, you should probably schedule your post to hit peak hours in that timezone rather than just posting randomly.

It’s also important to optimise for the right demographics, when it comes to the creator fund. The creator fund will pay you more, for viewers from the UK and the US. If you notice your RPM (how much money you get per view) is getting lower, maybe check your demographic stats. If the US and the UK aren’t the highest ranking countries, then worth trying to shift it back. I did this by talking directly about news stories and pop culture references for the UK. Just find something that is mainly dircted to those audiences. And the algorithm will favour them more. 

The final advanced metric to pay attention to is traffic sources. That’s basically where your viewers come from, whether it’s the For You feed, your follower feed, your profile, or even external links. If you find that most of your traffic comes from the For You feed, this is best. The algoirthm is organically pushing your content out. This is also the only feed, when it comes to the creator fund, where you’ll make any money. This is the one you want to prioritise. If most of it comes from your followers, you might need to work on making hooks that are more acessible to the masses, so it can get pushed out to fresh audiences. If a lot of it comes from in profile, that’s good as it means your thumbnails are working and people are clicking through your profile. 

So those are the advanced metrics you should be paying attention to. 

Follower conversion, percentage completed watch time, demographics, and traffic sources can all help you figure out exactly what’s resonating, what’s falling flat, and where you might be missing out on a bigger audience. 

Once you know how people are actually finding and consuming your videos, you can tweak your strategy to keep them watching longer, encourage them to follow, and ultimately help your content hit those massive numbers.
