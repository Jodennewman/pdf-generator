Podcast clips have become their own genre of online content. 

***throw up examples*** 

and pretty much all of the biggest podcasts have built their success from viral clips. 

The moments they choose to clip might seem organic and happenstance but trust me, the majority of clips that do big numbers online, are meticulously produced.

Here is how you can optimise your podcast for viral clips:

Firstly and most importantly you have to get the structure right. This needs to happen when you’re developing your podcast idea. The way to build that structure is by segmenting your podcast into format points and then within those format points, conversation points. Rather than just having your podcast be an hour of unguided rambling between friends, in which you hope there’s a few moments worth clipping, decide on 5 to 10 key points you want to include in the whole episode and then hit those points. Once it’s time to split them up for posting, you should have a healthy amount of clips ready to go.

Here’s how it works. Let’s say you’re creating a food podcast. In the development for the pod you might have three format points you want to hit. For this example they can be:

- Best dish
- Worst dish
- Dream dinner party.

The three moments where these questions are answered can be cut in to individual 40 to 90 second clips that are ready to post online.

This is a great start but you aren’t really maximising the number of clips you’re generating from a single episode. In order to do that, you need to have conversation points within those segments that your hosts have ready to go. Not only will these make for more clips, it’ll also fill out your podcast and maintain a structure throughout it. That way if conversation runs dry, you have them as a guide rail. 

In this example some conversation points could be as follows:

- Best dish
    - Favourite ingredient to see in a dish?
    - The best single bite of food?
    - What do you think is overrated? (This also then helps to transition in to the following segment)
- Worst Dish
    - What’s a dish everyone hates but you love?
    - If you could destroy a food stuff what would it be?
- Dream Dinner party
    - Rather have your bad boss or your ex partner round for dinner?

Now you’ve turned 3 potential clips in to 9 just by including open questions within each segment. 

It’s important to say that this structure is to guarantee you clips. It’s the building blocks, there is absolutely still an opportunity for organic moments to occur within the podcast that are worthy of being clipped up. This structure just allows you to have something to jump off of.

Now some other points to remember whilst producing your podcast to maximise the virality of these clips are the following. 

1. Try to keep these conversational topics or stories between 2-5 minutes long. This makes it easier to cut out those standalone clips and it keeps your long form product engaging. You do this by briefing the people appearing in the podcast to not spend too long on a single story or topic. Once it feels covered, move on to a new section.
2. Create visual interest: If recording video, use what you’ve learnt in the videography segments of the course. Multiple camera angles and good lighting will hold peoples interest. A few cuts to a slightly different angle can turn a video from a flop to thousands of views, just because it was slightly more visually engaging. 
3. Optimise audio quality: Clear, professional audio is essential for these clips. Use quality microphones and don’t be afraid to use these AI tools in your edit software to correct any blemishes (eg an echo, background buzz or a mic rustle)

Finally, just for when you’re actually editing these clips:

- Keep the videos between 30-90 seconds for optimal social media sharing
- Add captions - many viewers watch without sound and it’s become the standardised thing to do. It’s also eye catching and ups your chance of people stopping to watch your content.
- Include a strong call-to-action directing viewers to the full episode. Just a simple addition to the end of the clip or as a strapline at the bottom, telling the viewer that there’s a full length episode available.
- When you’re editing these clips you need to start on your strongest line: The first 3-7 seconds of a clip need to grab attention. If this means editing the clip non linearly, that’s fine. You just need your punchiest line or most intriguing question at the top of the clip.

Remember: The goal is to create content that works both as part of a longer podcast and as standalone viral moments.
