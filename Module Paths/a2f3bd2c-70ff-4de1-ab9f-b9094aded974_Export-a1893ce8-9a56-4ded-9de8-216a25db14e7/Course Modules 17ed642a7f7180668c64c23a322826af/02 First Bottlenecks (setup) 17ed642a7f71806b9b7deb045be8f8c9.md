Nailing your personal brand is an iterative process. Communicating exactly what you want to a new team is a challenge, and building systems that mean you can step away from the daily grind is a must.

You’ll need to develop clear guidelines to demonstrate exactly what you want from each member of staff you take on.

As you start, you’ll want to work with a small team (or by yourself) to establish and experiment on your initial style

In this trial period you will want to experiment with all of the concepts you’ve been taught in this course - what are your buckets, what does your set look like and how do you deliver to camera.

The first few months is entirely about trial and error, use a format 4 times to determine if it works, and if you see no promise in the numbers, can it and move on to the next.

The point is, whilst your in the testing phase, you need to be agile. Meaning, whether or not you have the resources, you need to start small and take responsibility (or have someone that takes responsibility) for quick testing.

Whatever you decide to do, removing bottlenecks as soon as they pop up is your main priority, and if its your project, a lot of the time, the bottleneck is you.

So, from a team that used to have a lot of bottlenecks, here’s what to steal from our structure:

- Always run through scripts before shooting, make sure everything you’re about to say, you’re happy to with the world seeing, otherwise your wasting precious time resource and money on videos you end up vetoing after edit
- Shoot in batches to cover two weeks, or even a month, so your not in constant crisis.
- Keep editor approval to a minimum where possible. Have a producer work with the editor on small details. Note that the goal at all times is for the editor to need less and less revisions, until they need only one per video. If the editor has been with you for months and isn’t improving, it may be time to find a new editor (more on that later)
- Be extremely structured about community management. It’s important - very important - but all you need to do is 3, down to earth, whitty replies per post, and then focus on other things
- Start with a week or two of videos for runway so your always ahead

Ultimately, you are the arbiter of the quality of your product, which means you will be the first bottleneck. When your used to doing it all yourself, it can be difficult to let an inexperienced team loose, but use these techniques, and you will have a robust system to train them, catch them when they fall, and put out stellar content.
