    Good research can really make or break your script, your video and your strategy. 
    
    Now, as all research work, there is no one strategy that works for one account. But there are deifnitey some tricks, methods and tools I’ve picked up that seems to apply for all accounts - that we’ll go through in this section. 
    
    First. I want to split up the two main types of research we’ll be going through. The first, is research for inspiration. Research to find WHAT to make videos on, whether that’s finding new ideas, formats or topics. All the stuff that comes before scripting. 
    
    The second type of research, is during scripting. And this is for finding information, stats, data to make your script more rich. And to find other pre validated content to make your script wording, even more viral. 
    
    So pre script research. And during script research. 
    
    Let’s start with the pre script approach. 
    
    **Pre Script**
    
    Great ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes it just comes to you. But other times you’re feeling uninspired and uncreative and have no idea what to make a video about, or what people will find interesting. If i’m ever in this state, I start off with ACTIVE general scrolling on short form platforms.
    
    This one always feels like you’re not working, because you’re just on social media, but being ACTIVE and engaged on these platforms is where most of my inspiration comes from. Sit and watch videos, and approach them with a critical mindset. What made you stop? What do you like it? Why do you think this has so many views? What are people saying in the comments? Sit and work out everything you can about the reasons a video works (or doesn’t) and what mechanisms are being used. 
    
    Also look at what people are talking about. In general I like to stay away from ‘trends’ but it’s still important to know what people’s opinions are, what pop culture references can you jump off, what’s happening in the world that you could make relevant to your content - that other people are already interested in. Understanding what type of content people are watching, is incredibly useful for research. 
    
    From my experience. Active scrolling, giving yourself maybe 30 minutes a day, and paying attention to WHAT is going on and WHY is the best way to research for ideas. 
    
    But. It’s not guaranteed. If you’ve done this and you’ve still got nothing, the next port of call is specific search. 
    
    Now the reason this isn’t the first method, is because it’s difficult. Search features of short form platforms are SO BAD. It’s very difficult to keyword search what you’re looking for - especially for if you’re looking for something specific. That being said, it’s still important and TikTok is the best place to do this (honestly instagram search feature is pointless, don’t waste your time). 
    
    Generally my best approach here is to find a selection of words and keyphrases (in both the UK and the US spelling) that relate to your general content buckets, pillars, and topics. 
    
    Now one of the main reasons that TikTok search sucks, is because it seems to only serach based on what’s written in the caption, or the hashtags - not the content of the video. So top tip here is to think about what someone would caption their video with, and search that.  
    
    In terms of filtering in specific search. From my experience, it makes it even harder. I wouldn’t bother. 
    
    If you’re still screwed here, then the next thing I’d do is go to specific accounts. In general per client I’ll have 5-10 other accounts that are in a similar niche, that I can use for some inspiration. 
    
    To find those accounts, keyword searching can be good, but the main way you’ll find them is through a video of yours. And the best way to find this is by tailoring your algorithm. So if you want to engage with marketing content, watch some marketing videos, make sure to engage with them (like, comment, save etc), and overtime more similar videos will start to come up on your feed - and eventually you’ll get the perfect research feed. It’s always worth having a new account for this, so you don’t mess it up when you’re doomscrolling. 
    
    As a general rule if you’re taking inspiration from another account, don’t take both the format AND the topic. Ill talk about this in the repurposing section. But just pick one aspect you li,e from your video — copying isn’t great. To work out what to take, just try and understand what you like about it (that active scrolling mindset we talked about earlier) extract that and iterate on it. 
    
    So for inspo on short form, active scroll, try you best at specific search, and find a bunch of people whose content you love. Just remember to keep that critical approach. Always look at how they visually and verbally hook you, check the comments for any funny takes or wordings. This is a great way to see what people liked/ thought/took away from the video. 
    
    The next thing to be aware with research is that inspiration is EVERYWHERE. You don’t have to stay on short form. A couple places I look are. 
    
    **Articles** 
    
    News articles are a great way to find inspiration on trending topics. Find publications and newsletters that talk about things you’re interested in/ align with your brand pillars. Check those every morning or evening and if you find it interesting, make a quick note of it in a doc, you can come back to flesh it out fully later. 
    
    Worth also searching up some key terms from the article or topic into short form after, to see if anyone else has covered it. If they have, again see how they visually and verbally hook you, and check the comments. 
    
    **Long Form**
    
    YouTube videos are another great source of inspiration/ research as they’ve got a much better search function, and all the videos are more informative. If you have time to watch a full video then skip through quickly and take away the main points and storyline - it’s a tiktok, really do not need to take the specific details out of it, just your takeaway. If you don’t use a transcript tool. I’ll took about my process with these later on. 
    
    **Podcasts**
    
    Podcasts are another great way to find content inspiration, things people find interesting, people that are interesting, and commentary on new stats or articles. In general find a couple in the niche and listen to them in the background while you’re up to other stuff (when researching for short form you’ve kind of got to always be on) If your ears prick up at something, then probably worth making a video from. 
    
    **Film/ TV and Books**
    
    Again, you don’t have to stick to the channels you’d expect. Although I don’t use these as direct research, very often I’ll find myself watching TV and notice a format or a game or a way of presenting something that can 100% be refactored for tiktok. 
    
    In general, to make great content, you have to be open minded and switched on to all great content. There is so much inspiration, in so many different ways, and ultimately content is just storytelling. A good content strategy will take what people like about other things, and inject that into short form. The beauty of these platforms is there are no barriers or rules and creativity is genuinely rewarded. So taking inspiration from anything and everything WILL benefit your strategy. 
    
    Ok now a little bit of during scripting research. 
    
    So, hopefully in your pre script process - if you’ve done all the things we’ve just covered - you’ve got short form links, article links, linkedin post links - whatever for each idea. 
    
    Try and write the script from just this.  Then venture out. 
    
    The first thing I try is, obviously, google. Stats are great to throw in so see if you can find even more articles or research papers that will add something to what you’re saying. No need to reference these, it’s not an academic paper, but throwing in that bit extra will make your content better. 
    
    What you should NOT do here, is rely entirely chatgpt. If you want to try and use this for research, go ahead, but because of its tendency to just make up information, don’t trust it. Honestly i’ve found that prompting chatGPT and then verifying everything it says (and then re-prompting if it’s hallucinating) takes up just as much time as just doing the research yourself on google. Probably not worth it. 
    
    Another thing to do, is find similar short form videos or youtube videos. So again specific keyword search the topics, and see how other people approach it. See what information they add, maybe they reference their sources and you find it out that way. 
    
    This process, specifically on short form platforms, is also really useful for coming up with ideas for your hook. Again we’ll talk about this further in the repurposing module, but ‘magpie-ing’ hooks is usually fair game. And you can get a lot of good wording from this. 
    
    So again all of the same avenues, but instead of casting your net as wide, simplify it, search for stats, interesting points, and interesting wording. But hopefully this process shouldn’t take anywhere as near as long as the first part.
    
    Ok so final bonus section:  **Transcript Tools**
    
    I mentioned it briefly earlier, but transcripts can be incredibly helpful to sped up the research process, especially if you’re trying to get a lot of videos resaerched and scripted at once. 
    
    And combining these transcripts with ChatGPT, or any LLM or your choice (but GPT is the best) is the best way to quickly extract information from videos. 
    
    For YouTube I use ‘Unlimited Summary Generator for YouTube’,  it’s just a free chrome plugin that gives you an immediate full transcript of a video. So if the video is long, put this into ChatGPT to get a summary out of it. It’s good to see if the video is worth your time watching/ to extract a few pieces of information. Obviously remember to double check everything, as it does hallucinate. 
    
    Then for TikTok and Instagram, the best way to get a transcript is to first put either through snaptik or snapinsta (both free tools again just on google, to download a tiktok video from a URL) then feed this video through a transcript tool, I personally use Descript but there’s many others you can use. 
    
    Then again can couple with with ChatGPT to extract a summary, or specific information. 
    
    As a disclaimer. It’s not good to fully rely on these tools. ChatGPT can extract information, but can’t necessarily extract what is ‘good’ or ‘interesting’ about a video - and definitely can’t analyse why it may have gone viral or what YOU should take from it. So don’t rely on this to provide any higher insights. However it is great for video structure, finding stats, finding patterns between someone’s videos, or just extracting raw summary information or facts (although again, please double check). 
    
    So to conclude. Short form research is pretty unstructured. You can kind of take information from anywhere and everywhere. And a lot of getting good ideas just comes from being switched on. 
    
    I promise it does get easier though. Early on when you’re developing your strategy, finding your inspiration accounts and newsletters, it will take a lot more effort. But once the ball is rolling, and you’ve found that, you don’t have to spend quite as much time as before. A lot of it will just come to your through your feed, and various other info channels you’ve curated. 
    
    Also as your platform grows, you can repeat a lot of videos into series, so it’s not like you’re starting from scratch everytime. And if you’ve got an engaged audience and community, they’ll start asking you to make videos in the comments, so it gets much simpler. 
    

**Good research can really make or break your script, your video, and your strategy.**

As with all research, there is no one method that works for every account or every person. But there are definitely some tools, tips and tricks that I’ve picked up that seem to apply for ALL clients and all accounts. And in this section we’ll be going through them in detail. 

Before I get into it all. I have to admit that nothing is ever that straightforward. And there isn’t just one type of research for short form: there’s two.

The first is research for inspiration: that is, researching to find WHAT to make videos on, whether that’s finding new ideas, formats, or topics. Basically all the research that comes BEFORE scripting.

The second type of research is what you do during scripting. So this is for finding more information, stats, data to make your script more rich, and finding other pre-validated content to make your script wording even more viral.

So I’ll talk first about pre script research. Then in script research. And finally get into some tools, and the best practice research methods to learn when starting out. 

Let’s start with the pre-script research approach.

---

### **Pre Script**

Great ideas can come from anywhere. In the shower, late at night, when you’re on a walk. But this isn’t reliable when you’re making consistent content. There will be times where you’re feeling uninspired and uncreative and have no idea what to make a video about, you forget what other people find interesting, and even what you find interesting.  If I’m ever in this state, I start off with **ACTIVE general scrolling** on short form platforms. The key part of research. 

Now this one sucks, especially if you working in an office, because it doesn’t look like working. it just looks like you’re scrolling on tiktok. But this is where you need to be. Being ACTIVE and engaged on these platforms is where most of my inspiration comes from. Just give yourself 20 minutes to sit, scroll and watch videos, and most importantly: approach them with a critical mindset. For each video, think, what was it that made you stop? What do you like about it? Why do you think this has so many views? What are people saying in the comments? Sit and work out everything you can about the reasons a video works (or doesn’t) and what mechanisms are being used.

In this active scroll time, also have a look at what people are talking about OUTSIDE of your niche. In general, I like to stay away from “trends,” as they’re not great for community or authority building, but it’s still important to know what people’s opinions are, what pop culture references you can jump off, what’s happening in the world that you could make relevant to your content – that other people are already interested in.

From my experience, active scrolling, giving yourself maybe 20 minutes a day, and paying attention to WHAT is going on and WHY, is the best way to research for ideas.

But sadly, sometimes your feed will not supply the goods, and you coul waste 2 hours and still get nothing. Inspiration here is just not guaranteed. So ifyou’ve given this a go for a few days and still got nothing, the next port of call is **specific search**.

Now, the reason this isn’t the first method is because it’s difficult. Search features of short form platforms are SO BAD. It’s almost impossible to keyword search what you’re looking for – especially if you’re looking for something specific. All of that being said,specific search is still very still important and can be incredibly lucrative if done right. Now for specific search, even if you’re not posting on TikTok, do your specific search here, as the other platforms are useless (especially Instagram, it’s search feature is actually just a waste of time).

My best approach to specific search is to find a selection of words and key phrases (in both the UK and the US spelling) that relate to your general content buckets, pillars, and topics.

Now, one of the main reasons that short form search sucks is because it seems to only search based on what’s written in the caption or the hashtags – not the content of the video. So a top tip here is to think about what someone would caption their video with, and search that.

In terms of filtering in specific search, i.e., filtering by most popular, or most likes, makes it even harder. I wouldn’t bother with any of this. 

So find a bunch of relevant keyterms, and have a look through what content people are making. Here’s a step by step guide on how to find your keyterms. 

1.	**List Out Your Pillars**: Then write down every topic, subtopic, or angle you talk about (e.g., “marketing,” “email marketing,” “content strategy,” “brand storytelling”).

2.	**Synonym & Variant Search**: For each term, write down synonyms, abbreviations, or regional spellings. For example, “organize” vs. “organise,” or “marketing tips” vs. “marketing hacks.”

3.	**Use External Tools First**: Check Google Trends, YouTube Search Suggestions, or even Reddit to see related phrases people are using. This might give you better ideas than the short form platform itself.

4.	**Test them on TikTok**: Plug these keywords into TikTok search (one by one) and see what type of content shows up. Pay attention to the top accounts, the hashtags in their captions, and the comment section language. Save and engage with the good ones. 

5.	**Iterate & Evolve**: Keywords change over time. Keep track of which ones get the best results, and occasionally revisit or expand your list as things shift. 

Then if you’ve done ALL of that, and the keyterms aren’t really giving you anything. Then then the next thing I’d do is go to **specific accounts**. In general, per client account I’ll have 5–10 other accounts that are in a similar niche, that I use for some inspiration.

you can find these through the videos on specific search, similar creator’s followers lists (i’ll go through the details of this in a minute) or through google search. Searching “Top painting creators” or “Best pop culture TikTokers.” Often, there are roundup blog posts or curated lists that point you to creators worth following. This could be a good place to start. But they might not be up to date. 

Then follow them all, on all platforms. And check in with them regularly. 

As a general rule, if you’re taking inspiration from another account, don’t take both the format AND the topic. I’ll talk about this in the repurposing section. But copying isn’t great. To work out what to take, just try and understand what you like about that specific video (using that active scrolling mindset we talked about earlier), extract it and iterate on it.

To find those accounts, keyword searching is pretty good, but the main way you’ll find them is through a video of theirs organically cropping up on your feed. And the way to find this is by tailoring your algorithm. 

So how do you tailor your algorithm? 

1.	First I’d suggest creating a new profile purely for research, so your personal scrolling doesn’t mess up your algorithm. Try and log out of it every time you’re done active scrolling, and maybe set a timer on your phone for 15-20 mins so you don’t accidentally doomscroll on it and ruin the algorithm. Overexposure can dilute your algorithm if you accidentally watch random comment.

2.	Then once you’ve built the new profile, dedicate a decent amount of time to searching up keywords and trying to find creators. Like I mentioned earlier: Search relevant names, click through good videos to accounts. Follow everyone relevant. Engage with all their best videos. Then go through their following. Good creators are all doing the same thing, and a lot of them only follow relevant people. So see which creators they’ve selected, and keep doing the same process. Ideally you’ll have 10-15 inspiration creators at the end of this. But honestly it depends on the niche. Some are way more popular than others.

3.	Then once you’ve built this mini profile, dedicate 20 min a day max, 10 min minimum, to scrolling this new FYP and liking commenting, saving and watching only the type of content you want more of in your niche. If a video is good, engage, go to their profile, if that’s good follow and check their following. If a video isn’t relevant, swipe away quickly. If a video is relevant but bad still keep it. This feed isn’t to ‘learn how to make good tiktoks’ it’s to simplify your research, so channels with fewer views that are incredibly information dense might actually be a good move.

4.	Over time, the more consistent you are with this, the more accurate your feed will become, and hopefully reduce your need to do much specific searching for inspo.

So for example, if you want to research for marketing content, search for it, find it and engage with it. Watch a bunch of marketing videos, make sure to engage with each and every one (that’s liking, commenting, saving, etcetera.), and over time more similar videos will start to come up on your feed. Keeping doing this consistently and eventually, you’ll get the perfect research feed, of tailored content. It’s always worth having a new account for this, so you don’t mess it up when you’re doomscrolling.

So for the pre script research approach on short form: active scroll, try your best at specific search, and find a bunch of people whose content you love. Just remember to keep that active critical minded approach. Always look at how they visually and verbally hook you, and check the comments for any funny takes or wordings as it’s a great way to see what people liked, thought, or took away from the video.

The next thing to be aware of with pre-script research is that inspiration is EVERYWHERE. You don’t have to stay on short form. A couple of places I look are:

**Articles**

News articles are a great way to find inspiration on trending topics. Find publications and newsletters that talk about things you’re interested in or that align with your brand pillars. Check those every morning or evening, and if you find it interesting, make a quick note of it with a link to the inspo in a doc; you can come back to flesh it out fully later.

Worth also searching some key terms from the article or topic into short form afterward, to see if anyone else has covered it. If they have, again see how they visually and verbally hook you, and check the comments.

**Long Form**

YouTube videos are another great source of inspiration/research as they’ve got a much better search function, and all the videos are more informative. If you have time to watch a full video, then skip through quickly and take away the main points and storyline – it’s a TikTok, you really do not need to take the specific details out of it, just your takeaway. If you don’t, use a transcript tool. I’ll talk about my process with these later on.

**Podcasts**

Podcasts are another great way to find content inspiration, things people find interesting, people that are interesting, and commentary on new stats or articles. In general, find a couple in the niche and listen to them in the background while you’re up to other stuff (when researching for short form, you’ve kind of got to always be on). If your ears prick up at something, then it’s probably worth making a video from.

**Film/TV and Books**

Again, you don’t have to stick to the channels you’d expect. Although I don’t use these as direct research, very often I’ll find myself watching TV and notice a format or a game or a way of presenting something that can 100% be refactored for TikTok.

In general, to make great content, you have to be open-minded and switched on to all great content. There is so much inspiration in so many different ways, and ultimately, content is just storytelling. A good content strategy will take what people like about other things and inject that into short form. The beauty of these platforms is there are no barriers or rules, and creativity is genuinely rewarded. So taking inspiration from anything and everything WILL benefit your strategy.

I go through the true indepth process of how to repurpose all of this research into the repurposing normal, and repurposing linkedin modules. So make sure you don’t skip those.

### **During Scripting Research**

So, hopefully in your pre-script process – if you’ve done all the things we’ve just covered – you’ve got short form links, article links, LinkedIn post links, whatever for each idea.

Try and write the script from just this. And if it feels lacking, like it needs a bit more grit or substance. Then it’s time to start your during scripting research.

The first thing I try is, obviously, Google. Stats are great to throw in, so see if you can find any more articles or research papers that will add something to what you’re saying. No need to reference these; it’s not an academic paper, but throwing in that bit extra will make your content better.

What you should NOT do here is rely entirely on an LLM like ChatGPT. If you want to try and use this for research, go ahead, but because of its tendency to just make up information, don’t trust it completely. Honestly, I’ve found that prompting ChatGPT and then verifying everything it says (and then re-prompting if it’s hallucinating) takes up just as much time as just doing the research yourself on Google. Probably not worth it.

The next thing to try and do to bolster a video, is find similar short form videos or YouTube videos. So again, specifically keyword search the topics, and see how other people approach it. See what information they add; maybe they reference their sources, head there and see if you can find it out that way. 

This process, specifically on short form platforms, is also really useful for coming up with ideas for your hook. Again, we’ll talk about this further in the repurposing module, but “magpie-ing” hooks is usually fair game. And you can get a lot of good wording from this.

So again, all of the same avenues, but instead of casting your net as wide, simplify it, search for stats, interesting points, and interesting wording. But hopefully, if you did the first part right, this process shouldn’t take anywhere near as long.

### **Transcript Tools**

Now onto some of the most useful tools to research quickly and effectively: transcripts. 

Specifically, the workflow of combining transcripts with any LLM of your choice (although GPT o1 is the best). This combination is the best way to quickly extract information from videos.

For YouTube transcripts, I use **“Unlimited Summary Generator for YouTube”**, it’s just a free Chrome plugin that gives you an immediate full transcript of a YouTube video. So if the video is long, put this into ChatGPT to get a summary out of it. It’s good to see if the video is worth your time watching or to extract a few pieces of information. Obviously, remember to double check everything, as it does hallucinate.

Then for TikTok and Instagram, the best way to get a transcript is to first put either through **snaptik** or **snapinsta** (both free tools - again just on Google - to download a TikTok video from a URL). Then feed this video through a transcript tool. I personally use Descript, but there are many others you can use.

Again then couple this with ChatGPT to get a summary or specific information.

As a disclaimer: these tools are great and will save you a lot of time, but it’s not good to fully rely on them. ChatGPT can extract information, but can’t necessarily extract what is “good” or “interesting” about a video – and definitely can’t analyze why it may have gone viral or what YOU should take from it. So don’t rely on this to provide any higher insights. However, it is great for video structure, finding stats, finding patterns between someone’s videos, or just extracting raw summary information or facts (although again, please double check).

Another great tool for research - and a slight cheat code in general, is the website archive.is. This one is great when you’re researching articles and you come across a paywall. Head to that URL, and paste in the URL of the article with a paywall. it will then load up the most recent cached version of the article for you to read, for free. 

Now obviously as its cached, the information may not be completely up to date - often journalists will go back and amend previous articles or headlines if they got something wrong. So just double check the fact with a quick google if you think its necessary. 

So research. Again, there is no clear cut formula to doing it right. But when you’re starting a new account or strategy try and gather as many sources of information, and save it all, so its easy to access in future. Create a huge inspiration bank you can go back to again and again. Including a tailored algorithm. Then to stay up to date, active scrolling is key. Observe what hooks you, the topics people discuss, and how they present them. Almost all the best, most unique ideas come from paying close attention to what’s already working.
