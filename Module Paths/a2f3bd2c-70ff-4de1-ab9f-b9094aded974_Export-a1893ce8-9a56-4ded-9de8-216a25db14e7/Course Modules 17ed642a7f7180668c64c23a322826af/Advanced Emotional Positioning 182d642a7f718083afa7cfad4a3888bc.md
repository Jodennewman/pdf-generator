This section is all about emotions - **anger, fear, surprise**, **and catharsis** and will cover when - and how - to use them to improve your content strategy. 

In the the scripting session we talked all about how to keep people engaged after you’ve hooked them. And one of the key ways to do this, was of course, storytelling. Tapping into emotion. 

In this section we’ll give you the tools to actually do that, in a way that not only catches attention, but feels authentic to your brand. 

So why do emotions matter? 

Put simply, strong emotions **stop the scroll**. Like I said, good short-form is just good storytelling, and viewers can’t help but pay attention to something that triggers a **visceral reaction**.

Emotions are also a core part of every piece of art and entertainment we consume. Tapping into emotion isn’t some cheap ‘short form’ hack. It’s the basis of every book we love, TV show we watch, painting, piece of music, film, play - whatever. Emotion is the core of why we connect to a piece of content, and short form is no exception. 

What is unique to short form though is that you’re tapping into the quick emotions. The base emotions. There’s no time to slowly build them up and release them. We can’t trigger ‘hope’ or ‘existential sadness’ in a a mintue long tiktokt. So the emotions we have to work with are the base ones, the lizard brain survival emotions like anger, fear and surprise. And at the core of it all - catharsis. 

let’s get into it. 

First, one of the easiest emotions to tap into **Anger.** This is the loudest of all the emotions, and WILL drive the most engagement to your video - if you choose to trigger it. You can inspire anger through rage bait and controversial hooks. Basically, opening up a question and NOT providing the answer. This will cause people to RUN to the comments. It’s like an angry customer shouting down the phone to someone at customer service. If the viewer doesn’t feel the issue has been resolved, they NEED to tell you about it in the comment section, to feel any sense of resolution. This one is very easy to play with - but be careful. 
The problem with tapping into anger, is that it CAN reflect poorly on your personal brand if not handled correctly. So never take too much of a stance, try and use this to lightheartedly poke fun and let the viewers fight it out themeselves, and do some damage contorl in the comments - which we’ll speak all about later in the handling comments module.

The next emotion you can inspire is **Fear/Anxiety.** This can be a great many things. It can be fear of the topic - like crazy news or industry updates that could change their lives. Or more commonly, it could be fear of missing out. A lot of the reason short form works is because its - gossipy. Theres a million conversations going on at once, and the viewer want to be part of all of them. Making people feel like your content is a secret club or clique that they NEED to get involved in, will massively drive interest into your video, because of fear. 

Another popular emotion to tap into is **Shock or surprise**. This can be a jarring fact, a subversion of the format, or just a surpising visual hook that interrupts their pattern of scrolling. This works well in short form because it breaks the viewer out of autopilot, and means they generaly stay engaged throughout your video. 

But at the core of it, the best emotional reponse you can get out of your viewer is **Catharsis**. In this sense we’re talking about catharsis as that sense of resolution, of vindication, of justness, that the viewer gets through YOU or what you’re talking about. A great example of this is ‘worst boss react’s where the creator reads through a text interaction between a shit boss and an employee. Usually these end with the employee taking a stand, shutting the boss down and saying ‘what everyone **really** wants to say to their boss’. And people watching it love that emotional catharsis. Noone is watching short form in a vacuum, they’re all bringing their own feelings of unjustness, and anxiety, and anger and resentment - and if you can find a way to give this emotion an outlet - a quick moment of catharsis. They will love you, and their content, and come back to it time and time again (without really realising why). 

There are really hundreds of emotions to tap into through storytelling, so you can get creative with this one. But in general those four: anger, anxiety, shock and catharsis are the ones that will stop the scroll the most. 

Please though, do these emotions to *enhance* your story or point—*not* just as cheap clickbait. 

The short of it is: making people emotional will make you viral. But building a good strategy isn’t all about going viral. You’ve got to have some integrity. So master this balance, and you’ll have the perfect viral community building short form strategy.
