Creator intro - When the goal is to grow an account you need to think about every aspect of that account and while step 1 is thinking about what kind of content you want to create, which is massively important, step 2 is an essential stage that can easily be overlooked and that is starting the account. 

Founder intro - It sounds obvious but I‚Äôm going to say it anyway, growing an account for a brand requires a different approach than for an individual creator. Now, because social media is for people, not brands, you want your content to fit in with what‚Äôs around it. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen these glossy hyper workshopped brand pages that have about 2k followers and get barely any interactions. That‚Äôs because they stick out like a sore thumb and you don‚Äôt want to have your content fall into that hole, so the focus on your videos to promote your brand but not disrupt the for you feed is essential. But something that can‚Äôt be overlooked, and often is, is the account itself. 

For an example here, we‚Äôll be creating an account for Harry Mann the pottery maker. He also runs an interior design business but the content will be focussed on pottery as that‚Äôs a more social friendly medium.  

NAMING YOUR ACCOUNT:

Now as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware naming conventions on the internet can get pretty out there. There isn‚Äôt a hard rule on good or bad names but there are a few things to consider when picking account name. 

1. Does it communicate what you do or who you are in a succinct way?

You want people to almost immediately grasp what it is you‚Äôre doing online, Lets think of Harry our pottery maker. Harry could call himself [Harry.Man](http://Harry.Man) and it‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs his name but it doesn't say anything to anyone who doesn't know him. So what he should think about, are all the relative words to pottery that he could use, HarryThrowsClay, Burning pots, VaseByHarry. Sort, snappy easy to get names that communicate to the viewer immediately. 

1. The feel of it (Is it pleasing to the eye? Does it feel nice to say? is it easy to read?) 

Is the name a mouthful that doesn't roll off the tongue? Say it out loud as you‚Äôre deciding to help figure that out. If the name is HarryMakesUseOfSomeHardClay It‚Äôs a bit wishy washy. You want hard consonants that split up the name when it‚Äôs spoken outlilfe since that feels the best to say. Clash Creation. Boom it‚Äôs sharp and you can‚Äôt mis hear it.  This is where it needs be, you can test out alterations that include numbers or symbols if you‚Äôre in need of adapting the name because what you really want, is already taken. Sometimes you can work it in to the name, like Harry can easily be H4rry, people will read it the same way. 

1. What other accounts exist on the platform with a similar name? 

This is just standard market research, you don‚Äôt want to spend ages on a name that is already taken or means you‚Äôll have to add in 10 numbers and make it all feel inauthentic. It‚Äôs also a great chance to learn what the norms are in the niche that you‚Äôll be trying to enter in too. 

A NOTE FOR INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS:

Now Harry the pottery maker works because he‚Äôs 

FOR BRANDS: 

- Now if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôve got a big brand name already, It can be great. Look at DuoLingo and Ryanair for example, there accounts are just names after the companies, super well received and beloved accounts.
- If you‚Äôve got a smaller brand name adding a softener such as ‚Äòthe‚Äô like the nitro bar can add that hint of personalisation. TheNitroBar  includes the brand name, but it makes you ask more questions. It breaks down every word, THE‚Ä¶ NITRO‚Ä¶ BAR, is it the only one? Nitro is a cool sounding word, It‚Äôs a drinking bar or is it a like a chocolate bar? where as just simply, nitrobar, could be a name of some random person, it could be easily misread or misunderstood.

MAKE USE OF YOUR BIO, STORIES AND LINK SPACE

BIO:

A great social media bio should be concise BUT impactful. Start with your core point be it profession, niche or specialty. Harry the pottery guy, might start his with the phrase ‚ÄúI‚Äôm harry and I do pottery‚Äù. Simple and informative. 

Followed by your unique value proposition or specialty. Include relevant keywords for discoverability, but keep it natural. Again Harry here, he might have something like ‚ÄúFollow if you want to learn what clay, water and heat can do‚Äù. 

Add a touch of personality through emojis, a catchy phrase or some kind of joke (but don't overdo it.) Harry‚Äôs says ‚ÄúOr in many cases, fail to do üò¢‚Äù

End with a clear call-to-action or link to your most important content. Remember to use line breaks strategically to make it easily scannable. Keep it professional yet approachable, and ensure it aligns with your brand voice.

WHY YOU SHOULD USED PINNED INSTA STORIES FROM THE BEGINNING:  

Instagram's pinned stories feature is a great tool for organising your account and you should aim to use it from the get go. It allows you to create permanent, easily accessible categories of content right at the top of your profile. Think of these pinned stories as folders that showcase your best content, key information, and different aspects of your brand or personality. 

Unlike regular stories that disappear after 24 hours, these highlights stay visible indefinitely, giving new followers an immediate understanding of who you are and what you offer. For example, you might have a highlight for your most frequently asked questions, another for behind-the-scenes content, and another for testimonials or success stories. This organized approach helps visitors quickly find relevant information and get a comprehensive view of your account without having to scroll through your entire feed.

Additionally, pinned stories serve as a visual navigation menu for your profile, making it easier for followers to find specific types of content they're interested in. This organization not only improves the user experience but also makes your profile look more professional and thoughtfully curated. 

So when you start posting on Instagram make sure you use the feature and keep them up to date. 

YOUR LINK SPACE

This is where you can direct people to your other channels, your website or just your businesses landing page. Again, it's all in theme of appearing official and thought through. Use that link space to put something that validates everything you‚Äôre talking about. It gives the air of being someone that know what they are talking about!
