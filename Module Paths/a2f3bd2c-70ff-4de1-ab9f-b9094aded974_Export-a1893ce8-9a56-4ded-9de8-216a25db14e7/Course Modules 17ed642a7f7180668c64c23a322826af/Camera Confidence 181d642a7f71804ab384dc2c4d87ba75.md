A large part of achieving high views online comes down to how you present on camera. Anyone with a significant following will have confidence in front of camera that allows people to connect with them. Sure, for some people there is a natural performance ability that they just *have,* but for the vast majority of people, this is a learned skill. 

Ultimately there are just 5 things you need to know in order to build this confidence. I’ve filmed with a lot of people over the years and these really are the shortcuts to coming across confidently. 

- Firstly, practice. I don’t mean looking in a mirror or spending weeks perfecting your presenting style. I just mean talking in to a camera for a good 20 minutes before you start recording. You can film yourself on your phone, just tell a short story that you know well. Get used to telling it in the way you’d tell your friends at the pub, but to the camera. Trust me, if you give yourself 20 munites of talking to yourself before you start recording for your content. You’ll come across a hell of a lot more confident.
- Secondly, eye contact with the camera (or whoever you’re speaking too if it’s a 2 person podcast for example). This is obvious and you don’t need to be told again but eye contact absolutely conveys confidence *especially* through social media. People want to feel like you’re talking to them.
- Thirdly, elocution - Speak clearly and loudly. It massively helps to engage with your audience when they aren’t trying to decipher what you’re saying. Imagine you’re watching a stand up comedian, you’re a lot less likely to laugh if you can’t make out what they're saying. Whilst hyping yourself up to film with your 20 minute story time, work in some real mouth movement into everything you say. Content isn’t yet thought of as performance but it absolutely is, so warm up like a performer!
- Fourthly, a conversational demeanour - There’s another lesson to be learned from stand up comedians here. They almost never bark orders at the audience, they have a manner of speaking which feels like you’re listening to a conversation. yes they’re speaking clearly and loudly but there’s a bounciness to there movement, smirking, relaxed body movements. Use your hands as you would when you talk normally. Again, the audience wants to feel like you’re talking to them.
- Finally, patience. You’re not filming on a reel with only 3 takes available so you can’t get it wrong. It takes time to get things right and that’s fine. you’re filming digital so do as many takes as you need. If something just isn’t feeling right to YOU when you film it won't feel right to the audience, so push it to the back and come back to it later on in the shoot or perhaps scrap it all together. but, what you need to do, is have patience with it. As frustrating as getting your words wrong can be, getting angry and stuck on it will only sidetrack your entire filming process. Let it go.

These are ways for you to build up that camera confidence quickly but ultimately it is something that comes with practice. Look at Gary Neville. His first ever appearance on sky sports was awful, zero confidence. *play clip -* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VX6oLjyfD0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VX6oLjyfD0) 

and now he’s the face of multiple podcasts and a British broadcasting touchstone.
