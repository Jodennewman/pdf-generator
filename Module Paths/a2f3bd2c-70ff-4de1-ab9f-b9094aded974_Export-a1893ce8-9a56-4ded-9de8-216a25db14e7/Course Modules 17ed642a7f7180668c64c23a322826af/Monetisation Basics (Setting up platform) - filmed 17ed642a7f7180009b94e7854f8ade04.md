As a creator your goal might not be to earn your entire income from social media, but, monetisation is something that’s absolutely worth understanding. 

So let’s start by explaining the basic process. Essentially all monetisation programmes work the same way. Get consistently high views, post engagement and don’t break the rules. Then these social media companies will pay you a certain amount per view. 

Each app has its own slightly different ways of doing things:

THE PLATFORMS:

(THINK ALL 3 NEED TO BE SPOKEN ABOUT AT THE SAME TIME FOR COMPARISONS)

- TIKTOK
    
    TikTok has probably the most accessible monetisation system because it’s widely considered to be the platform that is the most direct to grow on. With that growth they offer several ways for you to earn money from your content. 
    
    VIEWS - The primary method is the TikTok Creator Fund, which pays creators based on video views and engagement. To take part in the fund, you need to meet 2 requirements.
    
    - Have 10,000 followers
    - Achieve 100,000 video views within a 30 day period.
    
    LIVESTREAM - TikTok Creators can also earn through TikTok ‘gifts’ that can be given to you whilst you livestream on TikTok. These ‘gifts’ convert into ‘diamonds’ and these TikTok ‘diamonds’ can then be exchanged for real money. 
    
    CREATOR MARKETPLACE - The TikTok Creator Marketplace is another way on the app to monetise your content. It connects you as a creator with brands for sponsored content opportunities, allowing you to earn through brand partnerships and collaborations.
    
    SHOP - TikTok Shop is another revenue stream where creators can sell products directly through their videos, earning commission on sales. 
    
    TIP - The platform also offers a tipping system where loyal followers can send direct tips to support their favourite creators.
    
    Now it's important to note that earnings can vary significantly based on factors such as audience size, engagement rates, and content quality. If your content doesn't perform well for a few weeks it can greatly impact the amount of money the app pays out to you which is why we’d never advise for your entire income to come directly from Tiktok. 
    
- INSTAGRAM
    
    Instagram's monetisation for Reels works through the Reels Play Bonus Program, which pays creators based on the performance of their Reels. To start earning, creators typically need:
    
    - At least 1,000 views on their Reels within a 30-day period.
    
    Now what’s different here is the program is invitation-only, and Instagram selects creators based on their content quality and engagement.
    
    Similarly to YouTube the earnings from Reels come mainly from ad revenue sharing. When ads appear between Reels, creators get a share of that revenue. The amount you earn depends on how many people watch and engage with your Reels compared to other creators on the platform.
    
    Now unlike YT Shorts and TikTok Instagram has a whole other part of the app with a well established monetisation process. This means creators can make money through brand partnerships, where companies pay them to feature products in their posts. 
    
    In a totally non rip off way, Instagram offers ‘badges’ during live streams and shopping features where creators can tag products and earn commission from sales.
    
- YOUTUBE SHORTS
    
    YouTube Shorts offers creators a dedicated monetisation program through the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). 
    
    To qualify for Shorts monetisation, creators need:
    
    - 1,000 subscribers
    - Accumulate 10 million valid public Shorts views over 90 days.
    
    Now different to TikTok the revenue model for Shorts is based on a share of advertising revenue from the ads that run between Shorts. 
    
    YouTube pools this ad revenue and distributes it to eligible creators based on their share of total Shorts views. 
    
    This means creators earn money from the overall Shorts ad pool rather than from specific ads on their individual videos.
    
    Additionally, creators can earn from Super Thanks, channel memberships, and merchandise shelves once they qualify for the Partner Program. 
    
    Unlike traditional YouTube videos, Shorts monetisation focuses on view count rather than watch time. This makes it particularly attractive for creators who excel at making short-form, engaging content. 
    
    YOUTUBE SHORTS ALT:
    
    YouTube Shorts monetisation works like this: Once you have 1,000 subscribers and get 10 million Shorts views in 90 days, you can start earning money. Think of it like a big pool of money that comes from ads shown between Shorts. YouTube shares this money among creators based on how many views their Shorts get.
    
    It's different from regular YouTube videos because you don't need people to watch for a long time - you just need lots of views. The more views your Shorts get compared to other creators, the bigger your share of the money pool will be.
    
    You can also make extra money through things like Super Thanks (where fans can tip you) and by selling merchandise once you're in the YouTube Partner Program. Just remember to keep making good content regularly and follow YouTube's rules to keep earning.
