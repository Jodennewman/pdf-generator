So in general the principles of short form content in this course apply to all platforms. But there are still some key differences between why one platform is better than another. I’ll run through the pros and cons of them quickly. 

[WRITE THIS ON THE BLACKBOARD]

So TikTok is the platform where you’ll grow quickest, the algorithm makes it much easier to be discovered as a small creator, followers are much less of a thing, meaning you’ll probably get your widest awareness here. 

But the fact that followers aren’t really a thing, also makes it a bit of a double edged sword. You’ll have much lower return viewers, and it’s harder to build proper community. 

So a TikTok strategy is best to use awareness to pollinate other platforms. And in general your content needs to be story driven, lo-fi and authentic. TikTok viewers HATE feeling like they’re being sold to.

Then YouTube Shorts. YouTube is much harder to grow on, and can have some pretty serious shadowbans, so in general a YouTube Shorts strategy is only really worth it if you’re looking to build an audience for Long Form content. 

Luckily if you are, the conversion between short and long form is very high, and your community on there is the strongest of any other platform. 

So again great, but only if you’re looking to make long form videos. A couple tips, only post once a day - unless you want to be shadowbanned, and clip content works very very well.

Then Instagram. Again Instagram is pretty difficult to grow on, as it is more follower based. BUT that means once you have grown, you get a very high return rate on viewership. Once someone follows you you’ll come up for them AGAIN and AGAIN. 

Instagram is also great for conversion. Many chat automation is everyone’s favourite. if you don’t know what that is, don’t worry i’ll cover it properly later, but many chat is basically an instagram specific feature that automates sending your lead magnet to people. It’s great.

Now in terms of strategy, instagram is much more visual. People like shorter, hi-fi entertaining content, authentic storytelling just doesn’t do as well on here. 

As a general rule of thumb. Use reels to drive awareness, and stories and DMs to convert. 

And finally Facebook. In general the only reason you’d go for Facebook is if you’re wanting to reach the 35-55 demographic. So if that’s your target market, definitely push this, but, otherwise it probably isn’t worth your time.
