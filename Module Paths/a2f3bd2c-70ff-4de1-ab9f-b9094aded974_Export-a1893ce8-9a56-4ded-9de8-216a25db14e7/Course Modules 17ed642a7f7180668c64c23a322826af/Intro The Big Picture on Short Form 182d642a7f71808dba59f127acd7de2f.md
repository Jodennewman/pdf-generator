So I’m sure if you’re here, you’re somewhat convinced on the importance of making short form content. Maybe you love it and want to start doing it yourself, maybe you’re just curious about how it all works, or maybe you’re incredibly sceptical and someones forcing you to watch this. 

Either way, short form is probably the most exciting investment, and most important investment that you can make into yourself or your brand. 

Short form, is, a new term, that just refers to quick videos, from 10 seconds to 3 minutes, that are generally watched on a phone - so all filmed vertically. And this is relatively new, unless you count vine, it only really started in 2015, and became popular around 2020? So very recent.

But in those few short years, it has grown insane amount. Now 62.6% of the global population is on social media, well over 5 billion people, and they each spend an average of 2 and a half hours on there. 

Video now accounts for 82% of internet traffic. And if you’re trying to sell them something, 96% of consumers prefer video over text when learning about a product/service and 73% of consumers prefer short form video over long form video when learning about a product/service. 

Plus if you’re trying to target genZ. It is THE place to reach them, nearly 70% of 15-24 year olds watch short form videos every single day. 

So if you’re trying to sell a product, or yourself, or just make some money. This is where people are spending their time. 

A lot of people see short form as a gamble, you send a video out into the void, and some abstract ‘algorithm’ works out whether it’s viral or not. But this is not true. There is a science to **why** videos perform better than others, that if you can understand and follow, will result in your videos going viral, consistently. 

We’ve done it time and time again. 

INCLUDE CASE STUDIES for Chris, Ben, Joden, Yasin, Joden, James and Charlotte 

In this course we’ll go through everything you need to know about short form platforms, algorithms, and give you all the tools you need to make viral content, consistently. 

This first section, will be an info dump on, all of the theory, of short form content. All of the beautiful things going on behind the scenes of a good video, that if you harness correctly, will make making a viral video yourself incredibly simple. At the end of this section you’ll walk away with the tools to be able to write viral scripts, hooks, and have a fully personalised content strategy. 

The second section, we’ll go through making that all a reality. Where to find ideas, how to research ideas, and how to repurpose other content into scripts. 

And finally in the section, we’ll go into how we turn that into reality. Holding your hand through setting up a shoot, recording yourself, editing, all the way through to posting. 

Plus, how to make some money from it all. 

Excited? You should be.
