Complex Formats and Remixing

Welcome back to formats, again. Assuming you’re watching in order we’ve just been through helpful formats 101. If you haven’t, then go back and watch that, because in this section, we’ll be taking it all a step further. We’ll be looking at everything you’ve learnt so far — Reacts, Listicles, Podcast Clips, two-things-at-once, Greenscreens etc. — and remixing them. To make more complex, unique, and engaging formats. 

First, a quick refresher of that last video: Formats are the ways to frame your videos - the cheese around the pill that can save boring topic, and ruin a good one. Luckily there are infinite ways to make formats, infinite words to find, and a few favourites (that we covered in the last module) that you can guarantee will get views. 

Before we get ‘crazy’ with them. Remember the basics still apply: no matter how complex or interesting your format combination is: you still have to hook viewers within the first couple of seconds. It can’t confuse people and it can’t *feel* like a sale.  Boring corporate confusing still needs to be top of mind. 

Ok let’s get into it. First, how to **combine** formats to maximise engagements. 

So layering two formats (and you probably will want to stick to only two) will create a richer, more dynamic and interesting video. Let’s say we wanted to combine a story time and list. 

Let’s start off with a storytime: “I lost 1 million dollars in 2 days, all because of a tuna sandwich”. Classic storytime hook, people are excited to hear what’s going to happen. Start telling your story, and then to regrab people’s attention, hop in early with the listicle format - “Lesson 1: Always log out of reddit in an internet cafe”. 

This combination is great, as people are still staying for the rest of the story, and the introduction of the listicle has basically rehooked them. The audiences know that theres a payoff of at least another lesson, and this will keep them watching. Plus they’re still excited from your storytime hook, as that payoff won’t happen until the end. Combining them makes your video better: this specific combo is great as it has the the emotional pull and authenticity of storytelling with the structure and retention power of a list. 

Another great combination is a  storytime with a greenscreen. ‘For example: This is last thing my boss texted me, before I realised he was my Dad’ 

Classic storytime hook. But you can bolster it by having a greenscreen in the background - in this instance the greenscreen will be the text conversation. Then you tell your story, and the viewers will anxiously hang around waiting for you to fully reveal the text behind your head. It’s using the greenscreen as a visual hook, to maximise engagement. 

if you’re doing something like this, especially ifyou’re not revealing the text straight away, don’t leave people hanging too long. The same principles of hook → deliver → rehook apply with visuals. Show them something, rehook, show them something else on the screen.

This combination of storytime and greenscreen is great as there’s as it makes the story more immersive, and more tangible, plus there’s something else going on on screen for them to look at, but there’s also a legitimacy and an authenticity to your story. Even if the text behind you is made up, people can see it, so they’ll believe what your saying more. Again this combo is also just very well optimised for retention, as the greenscreen works as there’s implied visual payoff. 

Another great combination, is the greenscreen and the listicle. This format works best for listing - visual things. Like ‘top 5 ugliest billboards’ ‘the 20 worst dressed celebrities on the red carpet - number 19 still haunts me’ or ‘3 email sign-offs that mean your boss hates you’. Again this is gold, as there are multiple things happening at once, the greenscreen gives visual payoff , and its retention optimised. 

Those are just a few examples but there are hundreds of combinations that work. 

But, not every combination does. For example, the two things going on at once format - like you cooking dinner - combined with a greenscreen - will probably flop as they don’t ADD to each other. And means you’ll end up falling into ‘confusing’ cardinal sin territory. So make sure the two formats are **additive**, and provide something that another doesn’t. 

So layer formats when you can get a more complex and interesting video out of it. But remember simplicity still has to be top of mind. The two formats should amplify each other, not overpower.

Ok so that’s remixing formats. The next thing ot think about, is breaking format expectations.  

You might be new to short-form, but most people on short-form have clocked in YEARS on there. And whether they consciously know the term ‘format’ or not, they definitely know where they expect them to go. A great way to engage, and surprise your viewers is to subvert this expectation. 

For example, you could hook your video with ‘Three types of heels all the cool girls are wearing this season’ and then immediately subvert to ‘now the boys are gone, let’s talk about institutional misogyny in the work place’. 

Now this strategy is great, as it can pull viewers out of their passive state into an active one. It basically wakes them up, and gets them ‘actually’ hooked into your video.  

It’s also great because, it’s playful. People become very used to the same old content on these platforms, and having someone bring out something completely left field, and play with your attention and expectation, will make them more intrigued by you. Make them remember you. 

The worry is here is of course that your hook will bring in the wrong audience, and send away the right ones. This is possible. But in general a good hook is a good hook, and hopefully enough people stay and engage that the algorithm works out who to send it to. 

A third fun thing you can do with you formats, and similar to the subversion method, is the unexpected pivot right at the end. This is basically a rehook through format, just keep people going right up to that final second.

One example of this is the ‘disrupted storytime’

• If the video so far has just been you, to camera, telling a story. Then towards the end, it’s great to pop in a short “two-things-at-once” clip. Like you rushing to open the door to collect a parcel, and you deliver the final point while running down the stairs. 

This particualr example is fun, as it feels more authentic, and almost like a fourth wall break into your life. But it doesn’t have to be that complicated. It’s basically just a tiny visual remix that keeps people watching because something new just appeared on screen. 

You can also do this unexpected pivot with listicle. Top 5 scariest on set accidents, and then right before you give the final one, jump in with ‘actually I just found an extra one that’s even crazier - deliver it as a greenscreen or react -  and then jump back in. This one is great as it rewards loyal viewers, which leaves people feeling extra satisfied that they stayed until the end - and they just might do it again next time you come up on your feed. 

This unexpected pivot move is really retention optimised too, as it can drive comments. People love to point out things that are different — and usually assume you’ve not done it intentionally - which of course boosts engagement. If I’m a few seconds into a video, getting a bit bored, and see a large comment section - i’m reading it. And if half of those comments are referencing something funny that happens in the second half. I will continue watching that video to see it happen — whether it’s interesting or not. it’s like FOMO, I want to be part of the joke, and so I’m intrigued. 

This last minute pivot can basically boost engagement from people waiting around for what is said in the comments to pay off. It lets the VIEWERS do the rehook themselves.

So that’s the art of complex formats and remixing. You can layer them, you can subvert them, and you can pivot last minute. Once you’ve got the basics of formats mastered, start experimenting. If done right, you’ll keep people watching longer, wake them out of autopilot with sudden shifts, and be able to combine what’s good about each format, for maximum engagement.

- 
    
    **a) Introduce a Surprise**
    
    •	**Example**: You’re doing a Listicle. Right before your final point, throw in an unexpected pivot: “Actually, I just got a text about this—turns out there’s a **fourth** tip no one’s talking about…”
    
    •	This re-hook can **extend watch time** because now viewers have a *new* reason to stick around.
    
    **b) Tie in a Narrative Twist**
    
    •	If you’re in the middle of a **Storytime**, act like the story’s winding down, then add, “But that’s not the craziest part. You won’t believe what happened **after**…”
    
    •	A second, mini-hook near the end refreshes viewers’ attention, often reducing that **final drop**.
    
    **c) Use a Cliffhanger for Next Time**
    
    •	“But what happened next was even more ridiculous—follow for part two.”
    
    •	If you’ve delivered enough **value** or entertainment up front, a cliffhanger can genuinely drive follows and future views. Just make sure you’re not *always* leaving viewers hanging without delivering on your promise.
    
    **Final Thoughts: Mastery Through Experimentation**
    
    •	**Test Frequently**: The most effective remix tactics come from trial and error. Post variations, track retention, and see where people actually **hang on** vs. drop off.
    
    •	**Stay True to Your Voice**: These advanced techniques are only as good as the authenticity behind them. If you’re not a comedic person, forcing humor might feel out of place.
    
    •	**Iterate, Don’t Imitate**: Take inspiration from others, but add your own spin. A fresh approach to an old format can become your **signature style**.
    
    Remember: The core rules—hooks, multiple points of interest, implied payoff—still apply to every advanced format. The difference is you’re injecting **surprise**, **combination**, or **last-minute pivots** to keep people glued to the screen.
    
    Happy experimenting, and get ready to **break some rules**—intentionally!
    
    **Quick Exercise**
    
    1.	**Identify Two Formats** from the previous module (e.g., React + Listicle). Combine them for your next video.
    
    2.	**Plan an Intentional Break**: Script a moment halfway through where you intentionally shift tone, format, or topic.
    
    3.	**Add a Final Twist**: Keep one last surprise or revelation for the last 10 seconds of your video and see how retention compares to your usual average.
    
    Use this bonus module to spark new ideas, refine your approach, and keep your viewers **guessing** in the best possible way. Go forth and remix!
