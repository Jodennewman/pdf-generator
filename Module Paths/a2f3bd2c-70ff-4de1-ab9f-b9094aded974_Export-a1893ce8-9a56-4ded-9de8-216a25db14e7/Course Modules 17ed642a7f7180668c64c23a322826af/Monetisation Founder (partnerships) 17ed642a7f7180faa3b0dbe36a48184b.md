#ad. Brand partnerships are the new normal for marketing. 

And the good news is, if you have a following, there will almost definitely be a brand out there who wants to work with you.

But, there are rules. Brands want to work with certain types of creators, and will reach them through selected channels. get ready for a map of how all of that works.

So, firstly, how do brand partnerships work?

Businesses are always looking for the most efficient way to get in front of their dream audience - their demographic.

And in the last ten years, a new form of advertising has popped up. Paying influencers to promote a product with content

Businesses in many cases prefer to partner with a creator than buy ad space, as the creator has built trust and authority with their audience.

But, not all creators are born equal, and if you want to attract brand partnerships, you need to be aware of how to make yourself most attractive to businesses you want to work with.

So, fundamentally businesses want:

1. a safe brand - they don’t want their product being sold by a nazi (or someone who makes bad taste “banter”)
2. An engaged following - increasingly brands are realising that followers mean far less than they used to - savvy brands will look for your engagement metrics before signing
3. And finally they’re looking for a creator with maximum alignment - this should be a priority for you too. Bring a business to the attention of people who genuinely need it and you’ve got a win win.

So - how do you go about finding partnerships?

Primarily, if you’re doing well online, its likely an agent will approach you. 

Agents are there to help connect you to prospective businesses and find the best brand deal for you. 

They are usually paid on a commission basis, and the good ones will help get brilliant deals that raise your profile aswell.

What’s more is businesses are more likely to approach an agency to help them find a creator to partner with - so being connected to agencies helps.

Whether you make these connections or not, you can still approach businesses by taking these steps:

- You are unlikely to find a partner if your below 10k followers (at least), so at any stage before this just focus on building your numbers

- Optimise your content to be brand friendly. Don’t swear, don’t cover controversial topics, and be the person a brand would want to have their name next to.

- Be extremely obvious in creating content a brand could see themselves in. If youve had no partnerships, create a free video for a brand you’d like to work with, and send it in your media kit.

And finally, create a brilliant media kit:

 A media kit is essentially your professional pitch—a clear, concise presentation that shows potential partners who you are and the value you bring. 

It should include a polished biography that tells your unique story, key statistics about your audience such as follower count, engagement rates, and demographic details, and examples of your best work. 

If you’ve already collaborated with brands—even in a self-initiated capacity—make sure to showcase these partnerships as evidence of your ability to deliver. 

Tailor your media kit to reflect your niche and the type of collaborations you’re seeking, ensuring that any brand looking at it can easily see the benefits of working with you.
