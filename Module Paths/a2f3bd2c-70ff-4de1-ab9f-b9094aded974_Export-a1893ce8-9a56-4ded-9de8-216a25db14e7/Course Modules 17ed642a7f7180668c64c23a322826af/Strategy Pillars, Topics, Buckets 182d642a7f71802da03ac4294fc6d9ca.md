    So the pure basis of a good short form strategy comes from, the kinds of content you make. Also known as buckets. Here’s my strategy to build them from scratch, through pillars, and topics. 
    
    By the end of this sub module, you’ll have a fully functional, ready-to-go personalised short form strategy. There’ll be an exercise at the end of every section, if you answer each of them, you’ll 
    
    Let’s start off with pillars. Pillars are the guiding principles, beliefs, and big-picture themes that define what you, your, brand or your channel stands for. Making these is pretty simple. start off by writing down the main areas you care about, or want to be known for. For example, if you run a fitness channel as someone who works full time your pillars might be ‘work/ gym appropriate fashion ‘sustainable and ahceivable nutritious’ ‘realistic workouts’ and ‘mindset and motivation’ 
    
    - Each pillar should represent a big chunk of your identity or expertise, something you can talk about for months (or years) without feeling repetitive.
    - Your pillars should also overlap with what your viewers actually want. If you are a marketing consultant who loves cooking, you can make videos about both, but early on there should be some cohesion or people just won’t understand who you are or why they should follow you.
    - These pillars are also, by definition, pretty broad. There is a space for very specific niche interests. Pick pillars that are big enough to spark curiosity on a wide scale, but still related enough that people see a consistent identity.
    
    ## 2. Topics Within Each Pillar
    
    Once you have your main pillars in place, you need to turn them into specific topics. A single pillar can spawn dozens or even hundreds of topics, each ready to be turned into a short, snappy piece of content.
    
    1. **Spinning a Pillar into Multiple Angles**
        - For instance, if one of your pillars is "Healthy Workplace Culture," possible topics can include "Toxic Boss Encounters," "Remote Work Boundaries," "Team-Building Tips," or "How to Speak Up in Meetings."
        - Let’s go back to that initial example of the gym/work account. Some great topics here would be: Topics: ‘lunch break workouts’, ‘post gym workouts’ ‘quick 30 minute dinners’, ‘meal prepping for the office’, ‘how to *actually* wake up at 6am’ and ‘*outfits that you can wear to the office, and to the gym*’
    2. **The Research Phase**
        - Look at the big corpus approach: check platforms (TikTok, Reddit, Twitter) to see what questions and pain points exist around your pillar. If people are asking, "How do I ask my manager for time off?" that is a topic in your pillar of "Healthy Workplace Culture."
        - Also check what your competitors in the same realm are doing: if you see a big conversation around burnout, that is another topic.
    3. **Pre-Validated Content**
        - If you see certain topics exploding on social media, adapt them to your style and your pillar. For example, a trending story about a "3-hour workday" can be turned into a short explaining how that relates to "Healthy Workplace Culture" or "Productivity Myths."
    
    ---
    
    ## 3. Buckets: The Intersection of Pillars, Formats, and Topics
    
    Buckets are essentially the recurring “types” of videos you make, each combining a pillar (the theme) with a chosen format (react, list, green screen, etc.) and a topic (the precise subject).
    
    1. **What is a Bucket?**
        - A bucket is a repeatable content type your audience recognizes.
        - For example, you might have:
            - **Bucket 1**: React format + your “Workplace Culture” pillar + “Toxic Boss” topics
            - **Bucket 2**: List format + your “Personal Finance” pillar + “Saving Hacks” topics
            - **Bucket 3**: Green screen + your “Tech & Productivity” pillar + “New App Reviews” topics
    2. **How to Form a Bucket**
        - Pick a pillar (e.g., “Good, Exciting Businesses”)
        - Pick a format (e.g., a list or reaction)
        - Choose an interesting, more specific topic (e.g., “Dragon’s Den Pitches That Bombed—And Why”)
    3. **Examples of Buckets**
        - **Fitness Coach Example**:
            - Pillar: “Managing Yourself/Productivity”
            - Topic: “Morning Workouts for Busy Parents”
            - Format: Reacting to viral “hustle culture” videos.
            - Bucket Name: “Busy Parents React”
        - **Entrepreneur Example**:
            - Pillar: “Startups & Growth”
            - Topic: “When Founders Mess Up Their Pitch”
            - Format: List of top mistakes or best practices.
            - Bucket Name: “Startup Crash Course”
    
    ---
    
    ## 4. How Many Buckets Do You Need?
    
    1. **Pick 3-5 Signature Buckets**
        - Especially as you start, having too many buckets dilutes your brand. Three to five gives variety without confusing viewers.
        - Each bucket should feel like a distinct style, so people say, "Oh, this is one of your 'react' videos," or "Here comes that short comedy format."
    2. **Test and Iterate**
        - From the corpus text, we see that growth is trial and error. If one bucket flops consistently, drop it. If you discover a new bucket that explodes, add it into your rotation.
    3. **Balance Broad and Specific**
        - Some buckets can be broad, attracting a large audience, while others can be more focused, appealing to a smaller but more engaged set of fans. Spread these across your content calendar to pull new faces in and keep loyal viewers interested.
    
    ---
    
    ## 5. Making It All Flow
    
    - **Step 1: Define Your 3-4 Pillars**
        - Write them down in simple language that intersects your passion and audience interest.
    - **Step 2: Brainstorm Topics**
        - Each pillar can give you 10, 20, or even more mini topics.
        - Use the idea of “prevalidated content” from the text: check what is already viral or engaging in your niche.
    - **Step 3: Pick Formats and Combine**
        - For each topic, think: "Could this be a list? A green screen? A reaction?" That pairing becomes a bucket.
    - **Step 4: Evaluate Performance**
        - Over the next weeks, see which buckets draw attention, which get shares and comments, and which feel forced or stale.
    - **Step 5: Refine or Replace**
        - Add more topics in your winning buckets. If something underperforms, pivot to a different angle or format.
    
    ## 
    
    Pillars give you long-term consistency, topics keep your content fresh, and buckets help you package your ideas into repeatable, recognisable formats. 
    
    By following this three-tier strategy, you avoid random posts that lack direction and instead develop a structured approach that resonates with both current fans and new audiences.
    
    Two or three quick “recipes”:
    
    - A simple React approach.
    - A short List approach.
    - “Story-time” approach (30-second anecdote).
    
    So, so far we’ve covered setting up an account, why your video is probably flopping, how to write a good hook and a good script, and some formats that turn up again and again on social media. You’ve got all the tools now to make a good video, but what the hell do you make videos about? How do you even start to come up with good ideas? Well good thing that’s exactly what we’re covering in this section. 
    
    The key to a good short form strategy is to have a few different content buckets, this basically just means 3-4 **types** of videos, that you’re known for. 
    
    You know that guy who makes videos reviewing wine? The one with the long hair?
    
    [toms wines]
    
    That’s how you want people speaking about your content. And we do this by making a few recognisable content buckets. These are surprisingly easy to make, and by nature, incredibly easy to reproduce, so that your content is easy to make, and recognisable. Don’t worry, you’ve not got to keep consistently reinventing the wheel. You’ve basically just got to come up with 3 or 4 ideas, that you can keep churning out different of. 
    
    Now the way to make a bucket is to simply combine a topic, with a format. Obviously if you watched the last video, we just covered formats, so you should be familiar, formats are your listicles, reacts, greenscreens, skits, et cetera et cetera, they’re ways of framing a video so that they’re fun and entertaining, and, recognisable. 
    
    And to make your own unique content buckets you’ve just got to pick one of these, and pair it with a topic. 
    
    Coming up with topics is simple. In short, it’s what you want to talk about. Your topics could be ‘30 minute meals’, ‘investing for beginners’, ‘IPAs’, ‘socio economic policy’ literally anything. 
    
    let’s go through a few content bucket recipes. 
     
    
    ### 1. **The React Recipe**
    
    💡 **Format:** Reaction video
    
    🎯 **Why it works:** It’s fast, engaging, and lets you piggyback on trending content while injecting your own take.
    
    How to do it:
    
    1. Find something in your niche that people are already talking about (news, viral clips, tweets, product launches, etc.).
    2. Film yourself reacting to it—this could be with facecam commentary, split-screen duets, or a stitched clip.
    3. Add value—whether it’s humor, insight, or a strong opinion.
    
    Examples:
    
    - A fitness coach reacts to a celebrity’s workout routine.
    - A finance creator breaks down a viral “money hack” and whether it actually works.
    - A marketing expert reacts to an ad campaign (good or bad).
    
    **Pro tip:** The best reacts either agree intensely or completely disagree—middle-ground opinions don’t perform as well.
    
    ### 2. **The Listicle Recipe**
    
    💡 **Format:** List-style video (Top 3, Top 5, etc.)
    
    🎯 **Why it works:** Lists are addictive. People stay to hear all the points and can’t resist ranking things in their heads.
    
    How to do it:
    
    1. Pick a list that speaks to your niche—anything from "3 things nobody tells you about X" to "5 biggest mistakes in Y".
    2. Keep it tight and punchy—get to the point quickly.
    3. Make sure each point builds curiosity—use open loops like, "And number three? This one will surprise you."
    
    Examples:
    
    - "3 things I wish I knew before starting my business"
    - "5 underrated coffee hacks for better espresso at home"
    - "3 lies the fitness industry keeps telling you"
    
    **Pro tip:** Odd numbers work best (3, 5, or 7) and leave room for engagement—ask people to comment with their own ideas.
    
    ### 3. **The Storytime Recipe**
    
    💡 **Format:** Personal or anecdotal storytelling
    
    🎯 **Why it works:** Humans are wired for stories. People remember stories far more than facts.
    
    How to do it:
    
    1. Hook fast—start with a juicy, weird, or unexpected line. ("I lost $10,000 in one night…")
    2. Tell the story with tension—build curiosity by setting up stakes.
    3. Pay it off—end with a lesson, takeaway, or punchline.
    
    Examples:
    
    - "I tried to start a dropshipping business at 18… here’s what happened."
    - "How I accidentally met Elon Musk at a coffee shop."
    - "I spent $500 on a wine bottle to see if it’s really better. Here’s the truth."
    
    **Pro tip:** The best stories are either relatable or aspirational—people should see themselves in it or wish they were in your shoes.
    
    ### How to Make These Your Own
    
    Now, let’s put this into practice. Your content buckets should be a mix of repeatable, recognisable formats that align with your niche. Here’s how you can tweak these recipes for your brand:
    
    | Format | Topic | Example Video Title |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | React | Investing | “Reacting to a $10M stock portfolio” |
    | Listicle | Marketing | “Top 3 ad campaigns that made millions” |
    | Storytime | Entrepreneurship | “How I made my first $1,000 online” |
    
    The key is to mix and match until you find a style that fits your content. You don’t need hundreds of ideas—you need 3-4 formats that you can repeat over and over.
    
    Remember: Familiarity is what makes people hit follow.
    
    Now, let’s go deeper:
    
    👉 What are 3 content buckets you can create right now?
    

So in this section we’re gonna talk about how to build the perfect personal brand short form strategy — focusing on how to build **pillars then turn these into topics**, and then **buckets**, step by step. And at the end of this section, if you follow the workshop, you’ll come away with a unique personalised short form content strategy and plan. 

Let’s go into it. 

Before we get to that I just have to say, that the key to perfecting a short form strategy is balancing what **you** want to talk about, with what your audience wants you to talk about. Now that can be tricky but throughout I’ll help with tricks at each level to try and get this balance right. 

Ok so the first place to start with a short form strategy is with Pillars. 

**So Pillars** are your big-picture themes, the core ideas and areas you want to be known for. For a fitness coach their pillars might be “Sustainable Nutrition,” “Gym-Appropriate Fashion,” and “Mindset & Motivation.” For an entrepreneur, they could be “Startup Growth,” “Healthy Leadership,” and “Investment.”

Pillars are the best place to start. Having consistent, predefined pillars will help new viewers understand quickly who you are, what you stand for, and why they should follow. It’s the core to building a community, and making content that makes sense.

The ideal amount of pillars is 3-5. And these can be as varied as you want: you can talk about IPAs, cooking and business. Or pottery, self care and fashion. They don’t all have to be in the same general area, in fact having a unique combination might actually be refreshing and make your profile stand up. You just need to make sure that each individual pillar, isn’t too broad  or too niche. 

So how do you come up with a pillar? Sit down with a pen and paper—now, or after this video—and ask yourself these 4 questions:

1.	What topics do you care about?

2.	What topics do you want to be known for?

3.	Do these topics have enough depth that you can talk about them for months without running out of ideas?

4.	Are other people interested in these topics? Especially on short form—are younger audiences interested? If not, can you tweak it so they are?

And finally, **are enough people interested** that there’s an audience for it?

After this process, ideally you’ll have **around 3 distinct pillars** that you can talk about, create content about infinitely, and that other people are interested in.

Don’t worry if your pillars are different from each other—you can talk about both pop culture and business. There’s no reason they all have to be super cohesive. As long as they’re genuine and fit the questions above, you’re good to go.

Ok now the next part of the strategy is breaking these pillars down, into topics. 

**2. Topics**

Now that you’ve got your pillars, it’s time to break those pillars into **topics**.

**Topics** are the **focused subjects** that live under each pillar.

For example, if a pillar is “Healthy Workplace Culture,” you might have topics like:

•	Toxic Boss Encounters

•	Remote Work Boundaries

•	Burnout Prevention Tools

•	and Corporate Language

Topics are important as they give you a structured way to come up with new ideas easily. They keep your short form content varied but cohesive.

To come up with topics that will do well on short form, think about the different ways your pillar affects people. Brainstorm common problems, dilemmas, questions, stresses, or interests people could have within each pillar. You can talk about these by highlighting the problem or offering a solution.

For example, if one of your pillar is “finance”. Young people aren’t necessarily interested. It doesn’t necessarily affect them. But what does affect them is making money, so your topics could be ‘side hustles to make money’, ‘businesses to start that don’t need investment’. Make sure your topics speak to the audience and their problems. Again. one of your pillars could be management. Young people might not be into “learning how to be a great manager,” but they are interested in how to **recognise and avoid terrible managers**. When coming up with these, get creative so that your topics are still your core messaging, but will resonate more with people on these apps.

If you need help here look into subreddits, forums, or comment sections to see what people are talking about—and want talked about more. And rely on personal experience: what can you say that will **add** to the conversation, or start a new one?

In general you want around 3 topics within each pillar that fit the criteria. So if you’ve got 3 pillars, you’ve got 9 topics. These topics will fill the entirity of your content strategy. So when you’re finished make sure these fully represent the spectrum of what you want to say and be perceived as. 

Then, the exciting bit, how to turn these topics, into an actual content strategy. Or how to turn them into - buckets

**So Buckets** are the **types of videos you’ll see on your page. T**he repeatable formats that will come up again and again. Like “reacting to videos of bad bosses,” or “making pottery inspired by the zodiac signs,” or “five signs your manager doesn’t respect you.” These buckets will form the basis of your short form strategy. The ideal bucket is infinitely reproducible. There are a million videos of bad bosses to react to, loads of different styles of pottery to make for each zodiac sign, loads of signs your manager doesn’t respect you. They’re key to an infinitely reproducible, consistent, engaging, and community building strategy. 

So how do we make them? it’s actually really easy. A bucket is just a combination of a topic - which we just created - and a format. We just spoke about formats, so if you missed that, go back and check it. But these are your reacts, storytimes, greenscreens, listicles etc. The framings of your videos. Now combine one of those - with a topic - and you have bucket. 

So If you’re promoting a banking app and one of your topics is “saving hacks for families,”. a bucket could be combining it wiht a listicle to form” “Top 5 Ways to Cut Down Your Bills” 

or a reaction format: reacting to peoples money saving tips (remember with reacts these needs to be bad tips) so the bucket is you reacting, criticising, and suggesting improvements. 

or a greenscreen format: comparing average house prices/ spending in then vs now, using news articles you found on the internet. 

Each of those buckets can be repeated multiple times. For instance, with the **comparison** bucket—looking at costs “then vs now”—you could do a video on house prices, one on car prices, one on basic food items over the years, etc. For reacts you can look at people managing their money badly, or people giving bad financial advice. And within that there are hundreds of examples. 

This infinite repeatability helps people **know you** for that content. They start recognising and anticipating those videos from your account, which helps you build followers and community.

It also helps the algorithm understand what your video is about and who to send it to. If someone interacts with 2 of your videos in a bucket, say the greenscreen comparison bucket, the algorithm is likely to show them the rest of that bucket, because it recognises them as similar. So having more videos of the same “type” isn’t just easy to make; it’s also more likely for them to succeed as a whole. 

We’ll go through this properly in the workshop. But the process of making a bucket is to sit down with the list of topics you’ve written down, plus a list of formats - including some extra ones you’ve found by scrolling yourself. Go through them one by one and think of ways you can combine them into buckets. Write down as many as you can, then pick your favourite 3–5. These will be your starting point for your profile — your initial **social media strategy**.

So how do you pick which buckets to do? you’ve got loads of topics AND loads of formats? 

Once you’ve brainstormed them, a good guideline for selecting them is the 70:20:10 rule. 

This means that **70% of Your Content should be Broad**

•	This is content that catches your everyday viewer. It’s accessible, applies to most people, and is mainly entertainment.

•	Yes your core messaging is still there, but it’s more about generating views and boosting your profile. People get to **know your face** and have a positive association with you. You’ll probably get the majority of your views from these videos, they’ll be the heavy hitters, and you’ll gain casual followers out of this. But it’s not deep authority-building or community building content.

If you want to CTA in these videos, only do it to a follow, or to another video on your profile. 

So of the 5 buckets you pick. Make 3 of these generally broad, and accessible to the average viewer. 

Then **20% of Your Content should be Focused**

•	So these buckets should go a bit deeper, they’re slightly more niche and more valuable than the broad ones. They could expect some **prior knowledge, or just be more educational than entertaining.**  

•	This is the content that **builds real community and authority**. Views will be smaller, but the conversion to true fans (and followers) tends to be higher.

These videos make sense to CTA to follow, and just to give general awareness of your other products or other apps or lead magnents. But not to CTA directly to. 

Pick 1 or 2 of your buckets to do this. 

Then the remaining **10% of Your Content should be Niche**

•	So this might be where you talk more about yourself, your company or just the specifics of your content, for the experts. 

•	These videos will probably not go viral, but they’re crucial for **selling**—whether that’s a CTA to your course, website, PDF, or newsletter.

•	You can CTA to sell something in every video if you want, but typically limiting direct “asks” to this 10% maintains goodwill with your audience and keeps it to the people who would actually be interested. 
So only have one of your buckets really go to this. 

So when picking buckets. Make sure most of them are entertaining and for the every man, then a couple are more valuable and educational, and save the smallest amount for niche high-conversion content. 

Now you don’t have to by any means stick to this ratio directly. **70:20:10** is just a good framework to look at your strategy like a sales funnel. 

•	**70%** is broad so grabs loads of people.

•	**20%** is focussed and nurtures them into fans. 

•	And **10%** is where you effectively sell or convert them to something (even if that’s just to following you)

As an exercise, if you have a list of 20 buckets, write down which ones you expect to be broad, focused, or niche. Then choose your favourite 5 generally based on that breakdown.

So, work out your overall pillars. Then break these into topics. And then finally break these into buckets - and select buckets that generally fit this pattern. 

now this makes sense for early on. But by no means do you have to stick to this. Some buckets are evergreen and consistently go viral, others people will get bored of, or some just flat out don’t work for you and your audience — fine. That’s why there’s almost an infinite way to produce buckets, and overtime you can try out new ones or new approaches as you go. 

In the workshop next I’ll follow the example of Harry the Potter, and how I’d create his short form strategy through this exact process. And you’ll get the chance to follow on and create your own.
