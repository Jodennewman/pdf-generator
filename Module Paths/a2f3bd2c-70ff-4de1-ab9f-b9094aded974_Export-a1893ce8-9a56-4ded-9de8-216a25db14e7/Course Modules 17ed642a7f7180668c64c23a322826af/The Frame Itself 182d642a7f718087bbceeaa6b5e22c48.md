So framing - how your video looks, and what that communicates to the audience. 

At its core, video is a visual medium, and yes there is audio, but the things people pick up on first - and frankly the difference between a good and a GREAT video - is all in the visuals.

And for short form, the key to great visuals is getting the balance right of keeping it engaging (not boring) but simple (not confusing). This section will cover all the tips and tricks to making sure you get that balance right. 

**The safe zone**

Probably the simplest way to nail the visuals, is to be aware of the safe zones. Because whilst your video might look great in your adobe preview or camera roll, that won’t necessarily translate to a phone screen.

There’s actually a lot going on on a short form screen, like the engagement metrics on the right hand side, the search bar at the top, and the caption and name down at the bottom. A key error I see people making all the time is forgetting about these zones, and having key information like a text box, or caption, or just a key part of the video covered up by these sections.
This doesn’t just make it unreadable, but also can make it look messy, cluttered, and unprofessional. 

One easy way to fix this is to use a safe zone template when editing.  There are ones for specific apps, but I’ve built this one that you can find ‘here’ to use while editing to double check there’s no overlap.

So yeah rule one. Just stay in the safe zones. 

**Visual hook vs visual disruption** 

Alright so we’ve got the bare minimum down, now how make your visuals engaging? How do you make it look good? Well there’s two different ways you can do this: via a visual hook, or via visual disruption. 

**Visual hook**

So a visual hook is a visual trick that useful on short form to imply a kind of payoff in the video, that, you guessed it, hooks people. And keeps them engaged.

Like if you see a guy holding a basketball, moving it up and down, and a hoop behind him, it’s pretty obvious he is going to throw the ball in the hoop. He’s not said anything about it, but he’s showed it. And this hooks people. 

You see it a lot with cooking accounts, they start the video with a bunch of ingredients on the counter, making it pretty clear they’re going to cook something - with those ingredients. And that keeps you watching. People want to stay for the payoff, so that they can feel satisfied. just like with verbal hooks, once the curiosity loop is opened, people will typically stay around until it’s closed. 

That implied payoff will keep people watching, and many hacky tiktokers use this to keep people watching till the end. 

A way you can do this in your videos is by using props, having a blackboard with numbers on. 

**Visual disruption** 

Visual disruption is similar, but not the same. It’s again a way to get people watching, to hook them, but no payoff is implied. 

We’ve spoken about this before, but when people are on short form they’re watching with a passive mind, not an active one. Visual disruption is a way to pull people out of passive, and into active - breaking them out of whatever algorithmic hypnotic spell they are under.

Most videos on tiktok will start a similar way, and we get used to the pattern, and used to scrolling. Visual disruption is doing something intentionally different - or even weird - to interrupt that pattern and get people to stay on your video. This can be done in a bunch of ways, like using a stupid prop as a microphone, being really close to the camera, moving a lot in the beginning of a take (like sitting down/ standing up) or just doing something weird. 

Now visual disruption is different to the visual hook because it doesn’t tell anyone what the video is going to be about. It’s just a way to immediately grab attention. You’ll then have to use a text hook, or your verbal hook and script, to keep people engaged and hook them again almost immediately. 

Visual disruption can also work great for comment farming, doing something weird and not addressing it will ALWAYS get comments, and therefore up your retention. 

Combining the two can be a guaranteed viral video, unless, going back to our cardinal sins, it’s too confusing. Again if people are overwhelmed and you’re trying to do too much, they are gone. So maybe just pick one at first, and try and nail that. 

- 
    
    This lesson’s all about what’s actually put on the screen,
    
    Any cinematographer will tell you that the way you light, frame, and cut things will communicate a message to your viewer, and it’s their job to make sure that the message being sent visually aligns with the intended message of the video.
    
    So quite simply, we’ve got our rectangle here which represents the phone screen, and bit by bit we’re going to look at what needs to go where.
    
    First, absolutely the number 1 step, we need to account for the GUI interfaces of the different social media platforms. Unlike YouTube or other editorial platforms, The engagement buttons, the description, and even the search bar appear on the video itself, obstructing your lovely video. Yes viewers can technically turn it off, but let’s be real, they seldom will.
    
    So let’s account for that. First we know there are engagement buttons along the right side of the screen, so we don’t want to put anything important there. Then the video’s caption usually goes somewhere around here, plus some platforms have a follow button here, some platforms have an ad down here, or here – so we can just discount that entire area. Then some phones have a notch right here so that’s in the way – and we can’t forget about the search bar here, oh and that weird TikTok shop button that’s sometimes going on up here – oh and don’t forget, most platforms have a slight horizontal crop – meaning the edges of your video aren’t here, they’re here.
    
    So with all that crossed out, that leaves us with this area – the only parts of the screen we can guarantee will be visible. And this area generally has a name – the ‘safe zone’. By the way, for those of you editing your videos on a computer, I’ve included this safe zone as a png overlay in the downloads section of this module.
    
    But ok great, this is progress, we know where we should and shouldn’t put things.
    
    Next we gotta talk about the order of importance.
    
    So, whatever the most important detail of your video is, should go in this general area – the visual centre.
    
    This is where we need to tap into a bit of design theory – so in short – one principle goal of design is to draw a viewer’s eye to the most important detail first, the second most important second, the third… and so on.
    
    The easiest way to do this is simply to put the most important detail where the eye is already looking, and people usually first look an image in it’s visual centre
    
    The visual centre is different from the geometric centre, basically, in short, people perceive the centre of a page to be slightly above where it actually, mathematically is.
    
    Hence why you want to put your key detail in this area.
    
    Then, one more vitally important thing, is to keep everything simple. You don’t want subtitles that move all over the place, while also needing people to look at what’s happening in the video, while also reading some text on screen. It’s important to keep everything clean, only use graphics when they really help tell the story.
    
    Video is a visual medium, which means visuals should support the message and give it the best possible chance to shine, not fight against it.
    
    Keep things simple, clean, and coherent.
