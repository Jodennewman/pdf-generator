### About project

A fully-comprehensive course about growing with short form video, targeted toward the more general viewer.

This will likely be in 3 tiers, a basic (Normie) package for phone shooter-editors, no more advanced than capcut.

A Package for Creatives, professional or hobbyist, who are looking to reskill or refine their knowledge about short form content. This will include more on Videography, and video editing, color grading, etc.

A package like ‘Creatives +’, or more like ‘Freelancer’, those who may already be professional creatives but want to add it to their offerings, and do it in a more ‘business-like’ fashion. This will have some stuff on client acquisition, and handling a bit of backend. Possibly a little on how to advertise these services using short form.

People who purchase will also get 3 months free Clash Creator Hub, a short form video help community, charged around £50 per month

Creating this will have

Many who purchase will be coming from the Social media content, usually lured in with a lead mag (one of these) and then given the indoctrination sequence, and bought during a ‘sale’ GLF sequence. They may also come through paid advertising or content directly
