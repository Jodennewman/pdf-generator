### About project

A fully-comprehensive course about growing with short form video, exclusively targeted toward founders, likely to already have some success on Linked In, and do not have the time to understand how to use short-form to grow their business and themselves. 

Many who purchase will likely be coming from the free Masterclass, either given live or watched on Chris Donnellyâ€™s LinkedIn Creator Course

Many watching will have teams or aspire to have teams, so maybe higher tiers of this course has modules or resources â€˜for the team membersâ€™
