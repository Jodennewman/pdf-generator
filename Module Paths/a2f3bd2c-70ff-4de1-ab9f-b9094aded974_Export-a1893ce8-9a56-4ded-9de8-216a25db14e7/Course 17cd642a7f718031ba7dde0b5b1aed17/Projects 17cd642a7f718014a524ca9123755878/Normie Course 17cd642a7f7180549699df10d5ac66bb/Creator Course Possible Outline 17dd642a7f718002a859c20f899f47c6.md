## **CREATORS’ COURSE**

### **Tier C1: “Basic / Normie”**

### **Tier C2: “Creator / Intermediate”**

**Audience**: People who’ve posted some Reels or TikToks but want a more refined approach. They might dabble in better cameras, or do basic color correction. They’re definitely wanting more than phone-level knowledge, but not quite building an agency just yet.

**Includes Everything in C1, PLUS**:

1. **Advanced Hook Tactics & Re-Hooking (C2)**
    - Clarity/Intrigue/Value in the first second, plus bridging hooks mid-video to keep retention high.
    - Using curiosity loops and editing patterns to reset viewer interest.
2. **Scripting for Storytelling (C2)**
    - How to script mini-narratives, comedic timing, or pacing that feels dynamic.
    - Possibly show examples of how you rework your own scripts 2–3 times until they pop.
3. **Stepping Up Your Production Quality (C2)**
    - Intro to better lighting, maybe a DSLR or mirrorless camera.
    - How to do a basic color pass (like in Premiere, but you can mention CapCut’s advanced color tools if that’s easier).
4. **Editing Deep Dive (C2)**
- Basics of timeline editing in something more robust than CapCut—like Premiere Pro, DaVinci, or Final Cut.
- Recap of your “batch editing” approach, reusing the transcripts from your Masterclass. Just keep it at an intermediate level.
1. **Multi-Platform Strategy & Collabs (C2)**
- How to effectively repurpose content for IG Reels, TikTok, Shorts.
