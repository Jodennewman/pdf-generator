## 1) LECTURE (Short Form Fundamentals for Founders)

Hello, fellow founders—**welcome to Module 1**. If you’ve made it here, you probably already have a decent track record on LinkedIn, a thriving business to run, and an inbox that never sleeps. Yet you keep hearing about this “short-form video phenomenon”—TikTok, Reels, Shorts—where 10-second clips can spark massive brand recognition. Perhaps you’ve thought: *Is this truly for me? Do I have time to dance around or do comedic sketches? Why bother if I’m already successful on LinkedIn?*

I get it. **Short-form** can feel like an alien planet—especially when you’re used to the professional environment of LinkedIn. Over there, you post your well-structured thought leadership or your big wins, and your network loves it. On short-form platforms, the user is in pure scroll mode, basically waiting to be either entertained or informed at lightning speed.

Today, I’m going to walk you through the **fundamentals** of short-form content specifically tailored for busy founders and entrepreneurs. By the end of this module, you’ll know:

1. **Why** short-form is not just for Gen Z.
2. The absolute, no-bullshit basics of how it functions.
3. A look into **my story**—who am I to talk about short-form anyway?
4. The key **pain points** short-form can solve for your business.
5. Why **LinkedIn** is an entirely different beast—and how that affects our approach to short-form.

Buckle in. This is going to be an in-depth crash course that you can either do yourself or pass on to your team. If you’re *extra* busy and can’t do it personally, feel free to hand them this entire lecture and say, “Listen to Joden’s voice for an hour. Then let’s figure out how to apply these principles to *our* brand.”

### 1.1 Hyping Up + Addressing Pain Points

Let’s start by stating some **facts**. If you’re reading this, you already have:

- A **profitable business** (or a very healthy seed stage at least).
- A **LinkedIn presence** that’s working. Maybe 5k connections, 20k followers, or more, plus regular engagement from peers.
- A jam-packed schedule.

So your immediate question might be: *Why the hell should I add “making silly videos” to my to-do list?*

**Here’s the hype**: short-form video is the *fastest* way to generate brand awareness in 2023 (and beyond). The algorithms (on TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or even the upcoming LinkedIn video feed) revolve around virality and velocity. **One** well-executed short-form clip can introduce your face and name to hundreds of thousands—or millions—of new prospects, partners, or hires. It’s like free PR on steroids.

**The pain points** I see founders repeatedly face:

1. **Scaling your brand**: Maybe you already have a personal brand, but you want to accelerate your recognition.
2. **Hiring & culture**: People want to work with “the guy who’s big on TikTok,” or “the woman who has 500k on Reels,” not just a random startup founder.
3. **Untapped leads**: If your business sells B2C or B2B services that can be interesting to a broad audience, short-form can funnel them into your pipeline **organically**.
4. **Time**: The biggest pain point. You’re drowning in tasks. You can’t be arsed to do a 16-year-old’s TikTok dance. Good news: **you don’t have to**. You just need a proven blueprint to make short-form content that works in your space.

### 1.2 Who Am I? Personal Story + Clash Story + Case Studies

Allow me to (re)introduce myself. I’m Joden (or sub in your own persona name), founder of **Clash Creation**, an agency that focuses almost exclusively on short-form strategy for entrepreneurs, industry leaders, and businesses that want to **blow up** online. Over the last few years, I’ve cracked the code on generating hundreds of millions of views by systematically developing content pillars, hooking strategies, and frictionless post-production workflows.

**But** it’s not just me. I’ve done this with folks like:

- **Chris Donnelly**: soared to 300k+ on TikTok in ~7 months. And he’s a founder himself, not some teenage lip-syncing star. He used short-form to talk about everything from workplace culture to big marketing campaigns. The result? Millions of views, massive brand credibility, and consistent leads from a channel he never thought possible.
- **Ben Askins**: Another founder who started with a small presence and ended up close to 700k followers on his short-form channels. Not by dancing. By packaging his knowledge in a way that appeals to the short attention span.
- **Yasin (Viral Video Club)**: Instagram from ~200k to ~600k. The content? Reaction formats, comedic twists, but always anchored in his personal brand.

Why do I mention these? Because I want you to see what’s possible: **regular entrepreneurs** with no prior “influencer DNA” harnessing short video to scale personal branding and, of course, **business opportunities**. We’re talking speaking gigs, joint ventures, new leads, brand deals, and sometimes ad revenue—depending on the platform.

**Clash Creation** started when I realized there’s a huge gap between big brands or content agencies and the real strategic approach an entrepreneur needs. Most content agencies treat short-form like an afterthought or do it “corporate style,” which flops. We do the opposite: a more **raw**, platform-native style, layered with founder credibility. That approach has netted hundreds of millions of views across our clients.

### 1.3 Why is Short-Form Social for You?

In a sentence: **it’s the single easiest, fastest way to find new audiences** that are otherwise hidden behind typical paywalls or algorithms.

Let’s break it down:

1. **Discoverability**: Platforms like TikTok or Reels run on interest-based feeds, not just networks. That means your content can be shown to anyone, anywhere—if it’s good.
2. **Short Watch Times**: People can consume 10 of your “micro-stories” in less than 5 minutes, which forms a stronger, repeated brand recall.
3. **Wider Funnel**: If you have a robust funnel (newsletter, warm leads, sales pages, coaching, product trials), short-form is the top: a massive net that’s cheap (or free) to cast.
4. **Cross-Pollination**: Win big on TikTok? You can easily re-purpose for Instagram or YouTube Shorts. Suddenly, your brand is everywhere.

By the way, short-form can help if:

- You want to **sell** something (obviously).
- You want brand authority in your niche.
- You want to break out of the LinkedIn bubble.
- You want to **raise capital**, ironically. Investors or potential hires might be impressed by your large following or your ability to present ideas clearly in short videos. (Stephen Bartlett does this incredibly well.)

What’s that? You’re not convinced? “My LinkedIn is enough,” you say. Let’s see why short-form is a different beast entirely.

### 1.4 Why LinkedIn Is a Different Beast

Let’s get real: **LinkedIn** has been the gold standard for professional networking for well over a decade. It’s where you share your big career milestones, highlight promotions, or do meticulously crafted thought-leadership posts. It’s also where the average user is in “serious mode,” looking for business or career opportunities, or building B2B relationships. That alone makes it fundamentally different from short-form platforms like TikTok, Instagram Reels, or YouTube Shorts, where content consumption is far more casual and entertainment-oriented.

But **how** exactly is LinkedIn different? Let’s break it down:

1. **Audience Mindset**
    - On LinkedIn, the audience arrives with a purpose. They might be scouting for jobs, checking out prospective clients, or reading about industry insights. This means they have **higher patience for text** and a more “actively engaged mind,” scanning for **professional** or **informational** content.
    - On short-form platforms, users open the app to zone out or kill time. They’re in a passive state, flipping through an infinite feed of sensational, comedic, or highly intriguing posts. If you can’t hook them in the first 2-3 seconds, they’re gone.
2. **Content Format**
    - LinkedIn thrives on **long-form** text posts, document carousels, and the occasional embedded video or poll. The typical post might be a 200–300 word mini-essay or a big story about how you overcame a startup challenge. People have a bit more patience, especially if you’ve grown an established network who expects that style from you.
    - Short-form apps revolve around **fast, dynamic videos**—anywhere between 15 and 60 seconds, sometimes up to 3 minutes, but typically the sweet spot is under a minute. You can’t rely on lengthy introductions or block paragraphs. The entire narrative has to be condensed visually.
3. **Community vs. Virality**
    - **LinkedIn** is fundamentally a “network-based” platform. Your post’s reach is often gated by your network: your 1st-degree connections see it, maybe some 2nd-degree if they engage heavily. Yes, LinkedIn can go viral, but that “viral” often means 50k or 100k views if you’re extremely lucky (unless you’re at top 0.1% influencer status).
    - **Short-form** is more of a “pure democracy.” A brand-new TikTok or Reels account can generate a million views next week *if* the content resonates. The For You Page or Explore feed surfaces your video to random test batches of viewers. If they like it, you explode. That’s why a founder with *zero* existing audience can pop off overnight if they nail the short-form formula.
4. **Tone & Professionalism**
    - On LinkedIn, there’s an implicit code of conduct. People are cautious about what they say; reputational risk is higher. The tone is often formal, or at least “polite corporate.” You might pepper in business jargon or politely reference your achievements, because that’s the standard.
    - On short-form, you succeed by being **authentic, approachable, and even a bit edgy or playful**. People want to see the real you. If you lean too heavily on polished corporate language, you come across stiff and, well, *boring*. So short-form often demands a different persona: you’re essentially stepping off the stage of a professional conference and stepping into a casual conversation at a bar.
5. **Engagement & Feedback Loops**
    - **LinkedIn** engagement is structured around “likes, comments, reposts, and DMs,” but conversation often stays in a professional lane. You might see supportive or congratulatory comments, a polite debate, or a personal anecdote. Growth is typically methodical—your network grows as you accept new connections or get recommended by mutual friends.
    - **Short-form** engagement moves at lightning speed. You can get 500 comments in under an hour if your video hits the right chord. Those comments might range from supportive to brutal, comedic to borderline insane. The algorithm notices everything: re-watches, shares, watch duration. If the video hooks people fast, it escalates your reach in real time.
6. **Discoverability Tools**
    - On LinkedIn, discoverability is somewhat reliant on strategic posting times, relevant hashtags, and initial engagement from your existing network. You can do direct outreach or inbound marketing, but everything flows through a more businesslike pipeline.
    - On short-form platforms, discoverability is driven by the content’s “intrinsic virality.” The algorithm is constantly scanning watch time, replays, shares, and comments. People who don’t follow you at all can see your post if the system deems it interesting. In a sense, short-form unleashes a random lottery effect, but one you can rig in your favor with good hooking and valuable topics.
7. **Live Streams & Video Culture**
    - **LinkedIn** does offer live streams or uploaded videos, but the user culture is still text-based at its core. Most people there read or skim, occasionally watching a pre-recorded speech or webinar recap. Video on LinkedIn is an extra, not the main course.
    - On short-form, it’s all about the video. If your face and voice aren’t front-and-center in a dynamic way, you might miss out. Even if you’re covering the same subject matter you’d post about on LinkedIn, you must adapt it to the quick, eye-catching nature of these platforms—like “snackable storytelling.”
8. **Brand Perception**
    - On LinkedIn, you look credible simply by having a tidy profile, visible endorsements, maybe a few interesting articles. It’s a professional environment, so the barrier to perceived expertise is lower if you’re well-dressed, articulate, and have a track record.
    - On short-form, you earn credibility by consistently delivering content that resonates. You show personal stories or behind-the-scenes of your business. The “face-to-face” approach fosters trust quickly—but you also risk negative feedback or trolls. The brand perception is formed by how you react to comments, how consistent you are, and whether you feel “authentic” on camera.
9. **Lead Generation**
    - **LinkedIn** lead generation is direct and typical. You connect with someone, they see your post, they message you about a potential partnership. Or you run a LinkedIn ad. There’s a certain linearity to it.
    - **Short-form** can drive leads in a more chaotic, yet explosive way. A single viral clip can funnel tens of thousands to your profile, your link in bio, or your website. You might get 300 DMs overnight. But to convert that mass attention into real leads, you often rely on hooking them, then inviting them to follow you on another platform or sign up for your newsletter. It’s a little more roundabout—but if done right, it can be unstoppable.

All of this underscores that **LinkedIn is a completely different beast** from short-form channels. It’s not just the interface or the social norms—it’s the entire system of discoverability, tone, content length, engagement style, and lead generation. As a founder, you can use LinkedIn to reinforce your professional identity and share in-depth knowledge with your existing network. Meanwhile, short-form is your gateway to a world of audience segments you’d never encounter otherwise.

**Does that mean you abandon LinkedIn?** Absolutely not! The best approach for many founders is a hybrid: keep your LinkedIn presence as your “home base” for credibility and professional networking, while also dominating short-form to expand brand awareness far beyond your existing circles. Then funnel interested folks from short-form back to your LinkedIn, where they can see your achievements, endorsements, and full business profile.

It’s a **two-way synergy**:

- **Short-form** → funnel millions of eyeballs to your brand → a fraction become curious about you → they find your LinkedIn or website and see your professional credibility.
- **LinkedIn** → you have a robust network already → they see your short-form hits → they share or comment, giving you extra legitimacy and bridging that professional-personal gap.

In other words, treat LinkedIn like your stable anchor for serious networking and in-depth conversation, while letting short-form be your high-powered rocket for broad, fast, top-of-funnel exposure. **Understanding these differences** is crucial before you dive in. If you go into TikTok or Reels with the same style you use on LinkedIn—wordy, formal, lacking a strong hook—you’ll likely flop. Conversely, if you carry over a purely comedic or “jump cut mania” approach to LinkedIn, your audience might think you’re unprofessional.

**Balance** is key—and that’s precisely what we’ll explore in the upcoming modules.

## 2) EXAMPLE SECTION

Let’s take a quick example: **Chris Donnelly**. He’s a founder, a marketing genius, pretty established on LinkedIn. When we introduced short-form to his repertoire, he started making 30- to 60-second reaction clips to, say, “outrageous boss stories” or “Weird Dragon’s Den pitches.” Each of those small reaction videos soared to hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of views.

Why did it work?

1. **Relatable**: Everyone’s had a boss or at least knows a friend with a nightmare boss.
2. **Emotional**: He’d add a dash of outrage or surprise.
3. **Alignment**: Ties back to his brand as an entrepreneur who believes in healthy workplace culture.

And guess what? Suddenly, more people found him, Googled him, discovered his LinkedIn, or even reached out for business inquiries. All from short-form.

## 3) WORKSHOPPING SECTION

Now let’s do a mini “founders’ workshop” to close out Module 1. I want you (or your team) to take **15 minutes**—set a timer, if you must—and jot down answers to the following:

1. **Your LinkedIn Persona**
    - How would you describe your current LinkedIn content style? (E.g., “I share thoughtful essays,” “I do short 200-word posts with bullet points,” “I mostly talk about AI.”)
    - What’s your personality on LinkedIn: more academic, more comedic, more serious?
2. **Potential Short-Form Topics**
    - If you had to pick 2–3 “hot topics” in your industry, what would they be? (E.g., if you’re in SaaS, maybe the biggest controversies are “Sales commissions,” “VC hype,” “Remote vs. in-office.”)
    - What are 2–3 personal stories or experiences that you might share? (E.g., “Scaling from 2 employees to 200,” “Biggest hire mistake I ever made.”)
3. **Barriers/Concerns**
    - *Time:* Do you want to do it yourself, or do you prefer delegating?
    - *Reputation:* Are you worried about being seen as “silly?” (If so, we’ll address that next module with brand alignment strategies.)
    - *Niche Overlap:* Do you need to keep it B2B, or can you go broader?
4. **“Why short-form might help me”**
    - Identify a single major business pain point that short-form can assist with. For instance: “Need more brand awareness,” “Need to attract younger talent,” “Want to pivot my brand from purely corporate to more humanized.”

By clarifying these, you set the stage for everything else we’ll cover in Modules 2 through 9. This short workshop is about bridging what you’re already doing on LinkedIn and your real business objectives with the *potential* of short-form.

> Pro Tip: If you find yourself stumped or not sure how your brand can translate into short-form, consider the approach: Make a short snippet from a topic you’d normally do as a LinkedIn post. If you’re used to writing a 300-word LinkedIn post on “3 ways to scale remote culture,” then that’s your short-form script idea. We’ll refine it next module with hooking methods and “anti-boring” frameworks.
> 

**That’s it** for this first module’s workshop. Keep your answers handy, because as we move forward, you’ll see how to convert these seeds of ideas into an actual short-form content plan.

## FINAL THOUGHTS ON MODULE 1

Short Form Fundamentals for Founders might feel like a lot to take in, especially if you’ve never considered TikTok or Reels as more than a place for comedic content. But trust me, it’s so much more. My entire agency and personal brand revolve around showing founders that short-form:

1. **Is** for you.
2. **Doesn’t** require you to become an influencer or a dancing mania.
3. **Can** transform your brand presence, your leads, your hires, and your bottom line.

Consider this your official invitation to the short-form party. Next up, in **Module 2**, we’ll dig deeper into the **first principles** (aka the 3 cardinal sins, as I like to call them, that kill short-form success). We’ll break each one down, talk about their prevalence on platforms like TikTok, and signpost the solutions we’ll tackle in subsequent modules.

Stay tuned, and if you have a moment, re-check your workshop notes. Keep them at the ready for the next module.
