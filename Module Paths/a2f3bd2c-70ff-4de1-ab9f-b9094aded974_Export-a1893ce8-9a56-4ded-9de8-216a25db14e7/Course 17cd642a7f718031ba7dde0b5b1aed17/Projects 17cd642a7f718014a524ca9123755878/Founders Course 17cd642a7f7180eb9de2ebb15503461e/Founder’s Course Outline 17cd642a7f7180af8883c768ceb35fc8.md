## MODULE 3: High Level Strategy

### 3.1 Demographics

### 3.2 Platforms

Go through the different platforms, unique strategies for each, and who each one is for. Explain the similarities/ differences in a short form strat for each (this course is all encompassing) 

### 3.3 Pillars

What are pillars, how do they differ on short form to normal pillars? 

Include example and strategy

### 3.4 Buckets

What is a bucket (pillar + format) how do you make them ?

### 3.5 Formats

Formats are types of videos - include examples and where to find them 

### 3.6 Buckets (again)

So you’ve got pillars, you’ve got your formats, lets come back to buckets. 

Worked exercise. Come up with 5 buckets for this person (compare to pre val answers)

Spend some time coming up with your own 

### 3.7 Research and Pre Validated Content

Best way to a good social media strategy is to STEAL. Find who in your niche is doing well, see what they’re good at, what they’re bad at. if no-one in your niche - you’e got a huge opportunity. Can also look at other niches 

No need to reinvent the wheel. Steal like an artist 

### 3.8 Tip of the iceberg

Be wary when stealing content. Many things beneath the surface that could be the reason the video did so well (follower count, trends, paid push) that mean it is not guaranteed viral. 

### 3.9 Iterating

The landscape changes fast. Iteration is key. 

### 3.10 Broad, Focussed, Niche

Next section will discuss a three tiered approach to building a content strategy: Broad, Focussed, and Niche.

### 3.10.1 Broad

The majority of content and views. Entertaining, for the every man.

### 3.10.2 Focussed

Content for your followers. Not directly converting, but for the die hard fans. 

### 3.10.3 Niche

Your sale. Push yourself and your brand here. This is where you get people to your lead mag (don’t worry we’ll get to that later) 

Exercise: Go through your pillars and find an example of broad, focussed, and niche content. Think about **who** will find each interesting if you’re struggling. if all are niche, or all are broad. Try again. 

### 3.10 Conclusion

Summary of everything discussed. Pillars → Buckets → 3 Tiered. All embedded with PVC, and awareness for each platform.

## MODULE 4: Scripting and Hooks

### 4.0 Module Intro

This module will be about how to turn that strategy you just developed into actual videos. 

### (Tia to Film) 4.1 Scripting

Short form scripting is completely different to copywriting. 

Fundamentals of a good script. 

Think about scriptwriting like pushing a boulder on a path - give analogy.

### 4.1.2 Tips and tricks for good scripting

Go through line by line, could this be written simpler? 
don’t use any big words. 

remember the average viewer, would this make sense to them? 

### 4.1.3 Scripting workshop

Why is this script better than this script? Go through and evaluate why one is better than the other, from the principles outlined before. 

May be worse ‘writing’ but more evocative.

Bonus workshop, repurposing three linkedin posts into three videos

### 4.2.4 Pre-validated Hooks

Pre-validated hooks great idea (especially for visual hooks) but don’t just find them from a list - once they’re on a list people are already sick of them. 

Exercise, go through feed and find 5 things people are doing visually ON TOP of a verbal hook.

## MODULE 5: Viral Hacks, Analytics and Conversion

### 5.3 Conversion

Many chat, lead magnets, PDF, CTA’s, subscribers. The different conversions you can have, how to push for each, and what to expect. 

If wanting to make money this is a NEED. This is what the niche buckets we talked about earlier in the strategy will lead to. 

## MODULE 6: Filming & Visual Strategy for Busy Entrepreneurs

### 6.1 Intro

For each of these vids we’ll split it into two. One will be for the solo founder wanting to make videos of themselves. The other will be for teams wanting to make videos of other founders (can give this to your team if you have people already)

Explain myths/ logic around posting time, best practices on posting, importance of a good caption. 

### 7.5 Community management

Whether doing it yourself or getting a team to do it this makes a HUGE difference to your engagement. This can be engaging with other viral videos but in general should be replying to comments as as whne they come in . 

Best practice of responding to each different types of comment, and things to avoid when replying to comments. 

## MODULE 8: Batching, Delegation & Scaling Your Short Form

### 8.1 Intro to the Batching process

In general no-one has the time to film everything ad hoc, so, most people iwll batch their content. Sit down and film all their content for the next week, 2 weeks, month in one go. In general we’ve found that 2 weeks is best to be ‘on top’ of trends, and to give enough time to iterate (don’t want to make 1 months worth of content and then it’s all shit and cant change it) 

Also 2 weeks sweet spot to get enough to learn from 

### (Tia to Film) 8.2 Batching Scripting

Workflow starts with the strategy - and research that comes with this. Fill up a masterdoc with everything possible, this will reman your single source of truth. 

Outline process of creating 1 batch. Then process of creating batch 2 out of batch 1 (and everything in between)

### 8.3 Batching Filming

Do your set up. Start off with the easiest scripts first to get into the flow. 

### 8.4 Batching Editing

Will need a team for this. Explain the basics of a post productions workflow, how to do it most efficiently. 

## MODULE 9: Conclusion

Should have a personalised strategy, and an idea of how to implement it (whether in a team or not).
