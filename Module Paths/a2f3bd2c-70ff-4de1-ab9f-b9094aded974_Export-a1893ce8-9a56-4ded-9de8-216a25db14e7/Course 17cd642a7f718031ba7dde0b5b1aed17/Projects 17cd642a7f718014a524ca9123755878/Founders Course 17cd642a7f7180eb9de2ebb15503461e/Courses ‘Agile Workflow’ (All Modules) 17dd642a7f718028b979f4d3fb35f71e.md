## Conversions

### Taking people off Platform

- What does this mean?
- Controlling your data
- Populating other social media platforms (strengthen your fanbase)
- A newsletter or blog (behind the scenes content, further elaboration from videos) (deepen your fanbase)
- A community, where people can talk to you and other people on the same mission.

### Lead Magnets

- What is a Lead Magnet
- What is a good lead magnet to the scrolling audience
- Link in Bio, Link trees, Links on stories, Manychat automations
- The less obstruction to someone’s scroll, the more likely they will go through with the lead magnet.
- Manychat automation’s ‘comment KEYWORD’ is best here. Although as discussed, the conversation in comment sections is part of a healthy engaging video. If people go into the comments and only see people commenting the same word with no discussion, it looks bad. Like overwatering a plant. Get around this by using the DM function, OR by reworking your CTA to get someone’s comment to include the key word, or make sure your video is constructed in other ways to create discussion. Whichever way you go, ManyChat will automatically DM someone a link to download your Lead Magnet – which means it is less intrusive (they can continue scrolling and come back later), and it feels personal (even if it is a bot. This only works on the meta platforms, and does not have TikTok support – but it is something you could pay a VA to do (take precaution not to seem like a bot, otherwise expect suppression) – that’s down to the ROI.
- Stories is a good one as it gets viewers to engage with your page in a deeper way than just ‘link in bio’. Plus they can see a little bit more promotional material before clicking through to the app.

### YouTube

- Trailers for videos, or shallow versions where people can see the deep dive, or clips
- Like all platforms, YouTube segregates it’s traffic when deciding on whether something is worth pushing to the algorithm, so it will know that the flood of views is external so does little in ‘boosting’ a video. But it will provide you with those initial few (and it will be few) viewers of your videos.
- However you choose to promote your YouTube, be wary that if people are going over to merely ‘check it out’, or aren’t interested enough to actually watch it – your retention data could completely tank.
- Building a YouTube audience/subscriber list through posting on shorts is a strong first move. If you haven’t already then start uploading a short a day of your top performers on other platforms. Worth noting SHORTS VIEWS/SUBSCRIBERS doesn’t necessarily translate to longform views. In fact lots of short-form channels may grow massive through shorts, and have a small minority of viewers watching their long form. Use shortform to get people to your YouTube content, but make sure it’s playing by all the rules of the platform – Otherwise those initial few superfans that convert from your shorts won’t be useful. Be strategic, make sure you have a solid YouTube strategy before hitting ‘GO’ on all of this.
- Use the YouTube Community space to announce videos, subscribers don’t see everything.

### Newsletter

- An emailing list is good, but why not make it a product in itself How to build one,
- How it fits in the content ecosystem (Linkedin, Shorts, YouTube)

### How it builds your business

- direct Conversions (mentioned above
- The wider conversions that occur from having a super broad viral video, especially for those with B2B businesses, all other businesses are ran by regular people, who loved to be entertained. The best draw for new business is being universally liked. (Like with Charlotte)
