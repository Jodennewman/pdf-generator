1
00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:01.849
Joden Newman: What would you do

2
00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.270
Joden Newman: recording in progress? What would you do with 10 million views a week?

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.550
Joden Newman: What could you do with? You know just that coming in in any shape or form any

4
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.270
Joden Newman: any suggestions.

5
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:32.109
Joden Newman: Damn right, damn right. Monetize! Yes, exactly exactly more than anything. Monetize more people down more of a pipeline.

6
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.644
Joden Newman: It's good stuff, right? So

7
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.460
Joden Newman: sorry setup issues.

8
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:48.440
Joden Newman: So my promise to you with this presentation is that I can show you how to reliably get millions of fans to watch your videos.

9
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.920
Joden Newman: And this works in.

10
00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:19.879
Joden Newman: Let me make that bigger finance, property, education, business dev tech marketing software auto. It doesn't matter what you're in. Honestly, any business that needs eyes on a product is going to benefit from the things I have to say in this masterclass. Now the important question is, how do I know this? And, more importantly, who am I? So Josh gave me a lovely introduction. But just to sort of go with my own accolades. I worked very closely with Chris Donnelly.

11
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.860
Joden Newman: He hired me on to build up his Tiktok

12
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:36.689
Joden Newman: and Instagram accounts so, starting in April of 2023 we had about 4,000 followers then by May we had 10. Then by June we had 24, I think that says.

13
00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.780
Joden Newman: then by October we had a hundred

14
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:58.728
Joden Newman: Then by December we had 300 K. Yes, 300 k. And this is sort of how that graph looks so it is nonlinear. But yeah, that was my experience with Chris. He's since gone on to grow much, much more in my wake

15
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:12.830
Joden Newman: and then did the same with Ben started low, low number of 8, and over the 7 8 months we worked together took him up to around 700,000 followers. So great stuff there.

16
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:36.129
Joden Newman: Then I worked with a man named Yasin memory from Viral Video Club, focus more on his Instagram, taking him from around 200,000 followers to 600,000 followers, and just to outline here, this is his social blade. This is the area we started working together. And this is the extended area where, he was still putting out the videos that we've

17
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:45.539
Joden Newman: what that I had written for him. So there's a tangible growth difference there that roughly calculated to about 300 5,000 400,000 followers.

18
00:02:45.980 --> 00:03:06.699
Joden Newman: So of course, I was at that point about a year ago. And that's when I decided that I wanted to build more interesting brands at scale. I wanted to define a generation of new media at zenith, and I wanted to teach young creators how to get ahead when the education system leaves them very poor and impotent.

19
00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.510
Joden Newman: And also I wanted to make money. Just to be transparent.

20
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:27.890
Joden Newman: But I hit a brick wall. Yeah, starting off is very hard. I found it impossible. So many content ideas in my head, but nothing came out. I was procrastinating. I became miserable.

21
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:46.230
Joden Newman: It was. It was very, very tough to start going, and I was running out of money. It was a rough couple months. Here's me having a rough couple months, and then I found out that I had been undiagnosed with Adhd my entire life.

22
00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:56.230
Joden Newman: and simply some medication just would fix my brain. But then I had a bit of a problem. I only had

23
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:15.090
Joden Newman: a small amount of money left to sort of get myself out the pit I needed to make rent. I'd spent all my savings in my downtime. What was I going to do? Freelancing is too slow, risky, and would feel like a step back. Another job was not an option

24
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:33.883
Joden Newman: emotionally, and the only thing I could guarantee that I could do was make viral content. So that's exactly what I did. And I wanted to see without the restrictions of trying to be a personal brand. You know. How far can I push it? Knowing what I know about how the algorithm works?

25
00:04:34.490 --> 00:05:01.399
Joden Newman: and also the Tiktok Creator Fund was very pleasant at the time, and I thought that would be the best way to pump out money. There's a very much an effort in money out scenario going on. So in month one I was the 66, th fastest growing Creator in the world. In month 2 I was averaging 30 million views a week. Here's me very happy. About 500,000 followers, and in month 3 I had a million followers across all platforms, which is.

26
00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.900
Joden Newman: I can appreciate, incredibly fast. I was growth hacking, that is irregular, especially when building a

27
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.399
Joden Newman: a personal brand, but the the principles do still apply.

28
00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:31.449
Joden Newman: And I also did it not very consistent at all. Each one. This is my growth over those 3 months, and I posted see 3 times a week sometimes missed out, you know, just to show it's more about the quality and knowing what you're doing

29
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:47.820
Joden Newman: than any sort of techie you post 3 times a day and the algorithm rewards you any of that business. So since I've started my own company, we're an agency. We serve 4 clients at the moment, providing that same sort of growth

30
00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:57.929
Joden Newman: and creative content that builds up those personal brands. And this is this is us. Now, today, we're all very cute. So

31
00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:21.549
Joden Newman: to get into my general philosophy. And this is quite important to me. Social media doesn't have to be marketing. In fact, it's better when it's not. It can be creative and genuinely good, and still have the same benefits of marketing. I believe that as an artist truly to my core, it's not one or the other, and that's sort of an approach I bring to content.

32
00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:30.540
Joden Newman: Now, Josh sort of sold it a little bit. But we just need to talk about why you want to look at video and why you want to look at short form video, because

33
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:37.259
Joden Newman: everything has different benefits and short forms. Been a bit of an afterthought for a while. Now.

34
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.910
Joden Newman: well.

35
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:50.319
Joden Newman: to quote Gary Vee, the man himself. Whatever you're trying to do, whether it's selling a product offering a service or spreading a message, it can't be done without getting the attention of an audience

36
00:06:50.400 --> 00:07:19.459
Joden Newman: and video accounts for 82% of total internet traffic. 96% of consumers prefer video over text when learning about product or service. 96 and 73% of consumers prefer short form video to traditional long form videos when learning about product or service. And yeah, Hubspot, put a source in that because I was also amazed. Basically short form. Vertical video makes it easy to grow fast.

37
00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:49.289
Joden Newman: And there are a few other benefits, high viral potentiality. You're more likely to go viral earlier. There's a low cost. So you can get those iterations in. You can start learning that skill, quicker versatility. Now with Linkedin and X making short form content is an investment not just in one platform, but in like 7 and cross pollination being big on another platform will raise your profile elsewhere.

38
00:07:53.240 --> 00:08:14.689
Joden Newman: yes, yes, so I'll be any questions feel free to put them in. But I'll try and answer them at the end. Because, as I said, Adhd, one thing can throw me off track, and I'm out the window. Anyway. Short form video is this is a bold claim, but short form video is about to be the most important investment you can make for your personal brand. Why?

39
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.280
Joden Newman: Because of this.

40
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:39.570
Joden Newman: Josh mentioned this. We all know what this is. We all know what this means. This is the Linkedin video feed, and what we found from our clients and heard from others is whatever goes big on Linkedin. Sorry on Instagram Tiktok shops will go big on Linkedin. The same rules apply the same human brain is watching the videos. So it's the same things you want to learn.

41
00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:49.339
Joden Newman: And it's getting more powerful week after week. I don't think we're at the Zenith point yet of short form video on Linkedin.

42
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.619
Joden Newman: So just to break down, let me make this a bit bigger.

43
00:08:53.105 --> 00:09:12.080
Joden Newman: These are all the platforms that you can attack with short form video, you got Tiktok, Youtube, Instagram, Linkedin X, Facebook, and the 4 people who still use Snapchat you can see that monthly users monthly traffic that covers about the entire world 10 times over. So

44
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:23.119
Joden Newman: lot of benefit there. And just so, we all know when I talk about growing with video. I am talking about it organically. The 2 main benefits of organic. It's completely free. So no ad spend.

45
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:50.470
Joden Newman: And it's cumulative. The audience keeps ticking over every time you run a paid ad where you have to retarget, you know no one's becoming a fan of an ad. Some people are. But yeah, cumulative, more connective and a deeper connection with your audience. So I mean, we covered this but show of hands who thinks 10 million views a week, knowing what they know could positively impact their bottom line. It's very corporate language from me.

46
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:57.950
Joden Newman: Nice. That's that's that's pretty much all hands which I love to see.

47
00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.590
Joden Newman: Okay, great.

48
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:16.080
Joden Newman: So this masterclass is going to cover the 1st principles of making a good video. This will be the most important bit and a large bulk of it. Then we'll go into the high level strategy that will definitely make you an authority in your niche, and we'll get you 300,000 followers this year.

49
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:38.140
Joden Newman: Then we're going to talk about briefly on converting those viewers to your newsletter, Youtube podcast as I'm sure, all of you, if you're in this create accelerator. Have something of that caliber then we're gonna go over the fun stuff the viral hacks the way you hack yourself up to, you know, lots and lots of views. Easily.

50
00:10:38.500 --> 00:11:01.959
Joden Newman: And then we're going to go over how you can do it all in 8 HA month, plus a free gift, plus. It's worth mentioning at any point. All of these slides, and there are about 150 of them you can get from classcreation.com forward slash, masterclass. We'll send you the slides, plus a few other things that I'm going to go over later. But if you, if you're a slide fanatic.

51
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.200
Joden Newman: So

52
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:04.670
Joden Newman: to begin.

53
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.850
Joden Newman: how to 100% guarantee that your video will be seen by no one.

54
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.874
Joden Newman: But oh, bit of a slide issue. This is David.

55
00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.490
Joden Newman: he may be someone, you know. You may even follow him on

56
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:34.130
Joden Newman: for the slide fanatics. Yeah, there we go. He's a financial consultant, and he's the perfect example of how to get everything wrong when creating content. He's technical. He's jargon heavy. He's

57
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:46.369
Joden Newman: polished, he's disconnected. He's boring. He's vague, emotionless, and he's confusing. And I could keep going. But I think David would start crying

58
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.230
Joden Newman: now. So the 1st principles of social media.

59
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.390
Joden Newman: Oh.

60
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.860
Joden Newman: on short form videos

61
00:11:54.030 --> 00:12:05.840
Joden Newman: platforms. Sorry on the short form video platforms. People are only there to be entertained and nothing else. I will not hear any anything otherwise it's purely entertainment.

62
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:11.549
Joden Newman: The algorithm at the end of the day is just a conduit for everyday people looking to be entertained.

63
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:25.759
Joden Newman: So the algorithm you would have heard this before is nothing more than a reflection of the audience. And to think about it as something greater takes away from the humanity and authenticity of your videos.

64
00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:31.620
Joden Newman: So just to be respectful of the audience, how does this differ from Linkedin?

65
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:35.170
Joden Newman: Exactly. Exactly.

66
00:12:36.582 --> 00:12:56.840
Joden Newman: How does this differ from Linkedin? Well, on Linkedin people are there to connect. They're there to get a job. They're there to meet people. They are active. Their brains are switched on where on short form platforms. People are there to relax, procrastinate, rot their brain, and they'll engage with things that provide something called cognitive ease. People are passive.

67
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:20.600
Joden Newman: Now this is based off Daniel Kahneman's 2 types of thinking. You've got system, one thinking, which is the cognitive ease you've got system 2 thinking, which is suddenly the rational brains turned on. You're more alert, more stressed, more problem solving and on short form content. You want to keep people in the cognitive ease, because the second they come over to that system, 2 thinking, the second, they feel confused or like they have to

68
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:27.669
Joden Newman: use their brain. They're going to go on to the next one of one trillion videos they have at their fingertips.

69
00:13:28.232 --> 00:13:39.030
Joden Newman: So the yeah, these are the 3 Cardinal Sims of short form video. These are the 3 things. If you're flopping, you're one of these things, if not 3,

70
00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:42.200
Joden Newman: boring, confusing, and corporate

71
00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.720
Joden Newman: underscored

72
00:13:44.334 --> 00:13:54.110
Joden Newman: so I'm gonna go through all 3 of those. And they are, gonna offer me a great way to talk about sort of the main components of building a video. So we're gonna do both at the same time.

73
00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:02.660
Joden Newman: if yeah, let me. If anyone gets confused, just let me know. But yeah, we're gonna start cardinal sin

74
00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:03.790
Joden Newman: boring.

75
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.719
Joden Newman: And this is all going to be about your framing and your topic. So the very start of the video making process.

76
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:18.549
Joden Newman: So someone like David or one of you guys might send me a message saying, How do I make? Not boring content? Let me full screen this.

77
00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.089
Joden Newman: and I would say, Don't pick boring topics topics.

78
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.060
Joden Newman: and you would say.

79
00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:26.400
Joden Newman: like what?

80
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:35.789
Joden Newman: And I would say, crime, justice, beasts, heroes, villains, genocides, empires, relationships, wars, kings, gods, the great existential unknown.

81
00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.899
Joden Newman: Davis is okay.

82
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.010
Joden Newman: it needs to be about personal finance.

83
00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.000
Joden Newman: Let's say, app.

84
00:14:45.200 --> 00:15:11.929
Joden Newman: Well, let's think of a few ways. We can frame it so that it fits into the emotional impact of those things I mentioned and then David will definitely say, What if I say it? But I'm on a podcast and then he, you know, stares at a wall, puts a microphone in front of him, talks about himself. It seems to line up perfectly with the Linkedin post that he posted that week, and it gets 184 views. David comes back to me saying, Do you think I'm shallow band? And I say, stop texting me, please.

85
00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:14.170
Joden Newman: So

86
00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.560
Joden Newman: what is Raymond?

87
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:32.740
Joden Newman: Framing is the cheese you put around the pill? It's your the pill being your boring content. It's not boring, but just something that's not necessarily entertaining because you haven't framed it. Right? Yeah. People like stuff that is

88
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:56.240
Joden Newman: so framing should be emotional, interesting, pre-validated viral. You think the opposite of boring is interesting, exciting. People need to feel an emotion. You know, you talk about a productivity tip. But okay, that's not emotional talk about a productivity tip. That you know, brings my wife and kids back.

89
00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:07.790
Joden Newman: I'm in right? Extreme example. But we need to. It's all about being emotional connecting with people. So I've got some examples of framing even

90
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:33.069
Joden Newman: Joe and Bernie understand the react format. You've got top fives Buzzfeed, you know that it's great for retention. Podcast I did knock it, but it is a framing but people can tell when you're doing a fake one and then green screens, very visual. Puts you, you know. You can use an you can use an image behind you. It's a good way to discuss things, plus very lo-fi. It's a format people

91
00:16:33.537 --> 00:16:40.330
Joden Newman: understand? Plus, there's loads, loads more. And if you want to find them, just spend 10 min

92
00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:49.030
Joden Newman: watching tick Tock, watching Instagram reels. You'll see the types of framings and formats that people are using to take their

93
00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:56.150
Joden Newman: corporate or boring or just educational messaging and making it something that touches a human route.

94
00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:02.494
Joden Newman: and then, yeah, steal those formats and use them for yourself.

95
00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:07.749
Joden Newman: so let's make a video on productivity hacks.

96
00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:22.120
Joden Newman: How could we? This is this is to you guys in the chat. How could we frame a video on productivity hacks? Besides, the one thing I just mentioned to make it actually interesting. So anyone got any ideas?

97
00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:39.579
Joden Newman: What's the emotional result? Well, that's that's a good question. That's that's what you should be asking, what's the emotional result?

98
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:45.830
Joden Newman: that this is this is sort of what you gotta figure out. And, Fred, this is this is the it's a good question

99
00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.110
Joden Newman: start with unproductive, yeah, yeah.

100
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.470
Joden Newman: An outcome we never expected. Yeah, that's good.

101
00:17:53.630 --> 00:18:08.586
Joden Newman: Uncommon. That's a simple one. But that creates the novelty. Yeah. So one. I think someone just said like, reacting to like being really unproductive could be one like you're, you know, showing what not to be

102
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:29.119
Joden Newman: you're going to do. Yeah. So that's that's that's that's a hook. But that is very emotional day in my life being productive. That's yeah. So like, you know how you're managing your. That's a good one to say, like being a productivity hack that works when you've got young children. Suddenly that emotionally relates to a lot of people

103
00:18:29.566 --> 00:18:37.999
Joden Newman: yeah, stop being lazy. So like, yeah, to showing people something they don't want to identify as kind of a fear thing.

104
00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:52.120
Joden Newman: Yeah, no, that's that's all good. Yeah. Green screen, or maybe like a sketch, you know, maybe you do a lazy guy and a not lazy guy. There's so many ways. You can make a video on productivity hacks without just going.

105
00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:55.700
Joden Newman: Here's the Eisenhower matrix, because.

106
00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:58.249
Joden Newman: you know who's Eisenhower.

107
00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.370
Joden Newman: Anyway.

108
00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:18.380
Joden Newman: we're on cardinal Sin number 2 that was boring. We're now moving on to confusing, and this is, it's going to be a large one, because this is all about your hook and your script. And if you know, people love to talk about the Pareto principle, the 80 20. But hook and script is definitely about 80.

109
00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:35.910
Joden Newman: so yeah. And something worth noting is that creators who are very familiar with Linkedin come over to short form, all make a very similar mistake. That makes their videos confusing that I don't think they're realizing they're making so what makes?

110
00:19:41.360 --> 00:20:01.450
Joden Newman: no, no, it's fine. There's there's still there's still space for productivity. Hacks, man, I'm honestly, I'm not not speaking ill on them. Right? What makes a good hook? Well, most people would probably say, intrigue then value, then shock, then flashy visuals, then trending sounds. Well, shocker.

111
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.810
Joden Newman: No.

112
00:20:03.291 --> 00:20:16.550
Joden Newman: What actually makes a good hook is clarity or context, simplicity, intrigue, shock, and then value proposition. And now those are ordered in a specific way, because you can't have

113
00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.760
Joden Newman: any

114
00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:38.359
Joden Newman: before. But you can't have any of those without achieving the one before. You can't have simplicity without clarity in a hook. You can't be intriguing, if it's not, you know, understandable. You can't be shocking if you're not intriguing, and you can't propose to have value if no one is intrigued to listen on further. Basically.

115
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:48.028
Joden Newman: So clarity so important in a hook we're gonna go into. Don't worry. We're gonna this. This is probably going to be the bulk of it. We're going to go into some examples there.

116
00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:58.860
Joden Newman: here's 1 i see this. I actually saw this from a Creator who once again has a decent following on Linkedin. It's currently trying to break into short form. And this was their hook.

117
00:20:59.145 --> 00:21:02.750
Joden Newman: If I had to go back and do it all again, here's how I'd do it.

118
00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:05.340
Joden Newman: Any idea what's missing.

119
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:07.680
Emanuel Theander: Context.

120
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:14.730
Joden Newman: Boom context, specifically, yeah, what? What? It actually what it is. That's good.

121
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.630
Joden Newman: There's a really big one.

122
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:19.179
Joden Newman: I think.

123
00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:24.180
Joden Newman: And there it is.

124
00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.900
Joden Newman: Who am I? Yes, that's it. Who?

125
00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:30.580
Joden Newman: Who are you?

126
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:48.630
Joden Newman: Go back and do it all again. What you know? What have you done? Exactly. You may have founded a company. But if I had to go back and do it all again, like, you know, what does that mean? The addictions, the divorces, the war crimes or the startups. It's who are you

127
00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.279
Joden Newman: do? What? All again. And why should I listen to you

128
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:59.312
Joden Newman: and this? These are questions don't get confused. That's not intrigue, it's confusion, and it's rejection.

129
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:07.220
Joden Newman: and the the context of who you are is so so will be so so important for all of you growing on short form.

130
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:23.300
Joden Newman: And this is why it's different. Because it's all over Linkedin right there on Linkedin. It says exactly who I am. It even says I'm hiring, plus the fact I'm on Linkedin. I'm probably talking about a certain set number of topics, whereas you go over to short form. What's what's that?

131
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.430
Joden Newman: And yeah, basically, you don't until you have

132
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:36.663
Joden Newman: this. You know these big big numbers. I'm using Chris as an example here and a blue tick which gives you that inbuilt, assumed authority.

133
00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:46.640
Joden Newman: Well, what can you do? Well, the you'd have to, and people hate this, but you have to brag, brag, brag, brag

134
00:22:46.650 --> 00:23:10.109
Joden Newman: brag. Summer. Yeah, I get this all the time. I don't want to brag. I want to be humble. I don't want to say these big numbers all these successes. It feels so icky. It's so important. No one knows who you are, and they're not going to click through to your profile to find out. It's all about bragging, and it's about bragging up front. And I use the word brag, you know, just letting people know

135
00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:26.939
Joden Newman: why they should listen to you, because if you assume your audience knows anything about you, and you assume the audience cares about what you're saying, and you assume that what you're saying is so valuable that people would just be naturally drawn to it. Then you make an ass out of you and me.

136
00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:36.970
Joden Newman: so we need to show our authority. So how do we do that one upfront social proof? Say who you are, and how it relates to people in your hook

137
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:45.740
Joden Newman: and feel free to be tacky with it, you know, like people don't get nuance, so be direct and clear a little bit. Tacky

138
00:23:45.820 --> 00:24:09.989
Joden Newman: 2 white coat syndrome. This is a bit about your look, how you present yourself. Do you feel like someone who you know you say you are, you know, like, you know, everyone trusts a person in a white coat on science, because well, they're wearing a white coat. So it's about making sure that you feel. You know, if you're trying to sell a finance thing as a luxurious person. But you're wearing.

139
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:19.789
Joden Newman: you know, Rags, and you, you know you got stains on the wall. It'd be a bit like, you know, you know, wouldn't build much authority.

140
00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:47.380
Joden Newman: And then 3, the insecure teenager. This is one I talk about a lot. This is a more subtle way of getting across authority and brand messaging. But it's it's I liken it to a teena definitely not myself but a teenage boy who just happens to talk about the fact. He goes gym in every conversation. Just like, yeah, you guys going out. Yeah, I just got back from a gym! You know, benching one time that.

141
00:24:47.380 --> 00:25:00.939
Joden Newman: But it's your brand, right that. But it's your authority. It's nonchalantly slipping in. This is a thing. And when I was seeing my clients. This is, you know, like kind of like name. Dropping is very similar, you know.

142
00:25:02.013 --> 00:25:07.349
Joden Newman: But yeah, it's worth saying. This is a subtle way, always better to be direct.

143
00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:17.040
Joden Newman: So back to context. Remember, we're still in the the context confusion section. I did say it was very long. Second example of a hook

144
00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:20.009
Joden Newman: hitting the ground running is not a thing

145
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:48.939
Joden Newman: I don't understand why people keep saying that. Now I'm not gonna ask what's missing? Just get straight into this one. But this is a real hook as well. What's missing the counter argument, and this is really really important for your cause. When you're sharing opinions, you're all gonna have. Oh, company, culture, opinions or productivity opinions. Or you know, whatever it is, a niche dependent. You're gonna have your hot takes. Now.

146
00:25:49.290 --> 00:26:05.260
Joden Newman: the basis here is your thesis needs an antithesis. Every hero needs a villain. Every point you want to make needs the opposite point. If Spider-man had no enemies, he would just be a sticky weirdo. And you don't want to be that.

147
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:09.499
Joden Newman: So here's some examples of what I mean just to get that across.

148
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:16.549
Joden Newman: So here's how we could use a new story as our anti and antithesis.

149
00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:40.110
Joden Newman: So say this is your thesis. This is the point you're trying to make. Gen. Z. Aren't lazy. They're hardworking, and older generations don't understand how hard they have it. Well, your antithesis would be a news article. Jodie Foster divides fans. She hates Gen. Z. Thinks they're lazy. You go. Jodie Foster just sent this. It gives context to why, you're talking about it. You know

150
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:46.429
Joden Newman: another example. You need to eat greens, carbs, fats to have a well balanced diet. Well, I'd see that in a video and go.

151
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.379
Joden Newman: are you, my mom? What

152
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:56.749
Joden Newman: obviously, you know, like, what's the take here? Why, you say, you know, it's not really grabbing me because there's no story. But

153
00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:09.320
Joden Newman: you reacted to a video that's about the, you know, the brilliance of the carnivore diet. And suddenly, it's like, Oh, my God, yeah, we meet. We need more people like you advocating for this thing

154
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.200
Joden Newman: bothered me.

155
00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:18.789
Joden Newman: And one more way you're very familiar with is a sketch. So productivity culture is getting unproductive, actually

156
00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:42.949
Joden Newman: quite a lukewarm take on its own, but if you sketched it, you did it with you, and then you present the other person, someone who'd wake up at 3 Am. You know. Cold shower, Sigma male. I don't see my friends. Family, you know. Then oh, okay. Suddenly your point has a bit more of a of a weight to it. And then you're starting to position yourself

157
00:27:43.130 --> 00:28:02.550
Joden Newman: in what is a not very sensational area like productivity. It's not a sensationalist area to be in so doing. Something like this still positions you against the against something. So it shows people where you are, and it makes it gets people agreeing with you as well. Which is why it's important for building that

158
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.050
Joden Newman: brand cool.

159
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.900
Joden Newman: So yeah.

160
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.620
Joden Newman: once again, we're still on being clear.

161
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:12.470
Joden Newman: just making that clear

162
00:28:12.847 --> 00:28:21.179
Joden Newman: being clear on your hooks. So so far we've covered how to make it clear what you're talking about and why. So that's like step one of clarity.

163
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:34.229
Joden Newman: Now we need to cover how to make it clear why the viewer should watch. So this is going to be about that intrigue and that value proposition. And this is going to be about. You know more of the stuff you're familiar with. So why would anyone watch?

164
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:38.121
Joden Newman: But oh, I just said that. Okay, cool. I'm 1 slide ahead.

165
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:58.189
Joden Newman: So starting with your value proposition it needs to be. It needs to be realistic. People need to believe you're actually going to when you propose that value, you're the person who's going to achieve it. So that might be to do with what we talked about in authority, and they need to believe it's actually valuable, you know, like applicable

166
00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:15.970
Joden Newman: to someone's life. Now, that's not just educational content. That could be news or gossip, or whatever it's like. Oh, could I say that to someone? Will I receive some benefit down the line from this otherwise? Or is it just an immense amount of novelty that's really, really entertaining.

167
00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:19.230
Joden Newman: That's the 2 things with a value proposition.

168
00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.180
Joden Newman: Okay? Intrigue.

169
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:36.220
Joden Newman: yes. So with intrigue. Really, it's writing out a hook when you write a hook? You really want to think about how many questions it raises, and it's important that they aren't questions like we had before. Of who are you? Why would I listen?

170
00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:40.230
Joden Newman: Why are you know it's more questions of like

171
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:53.740
Joden Newman: that you genuinely want answered so good practices to write out a hook and think, how many questions does it raise, and a good rule of thumb for this is more details, equals more questions, equals, more intrigue.

172
00:29:53.850 --> 00:30:08.549
Joden Newman: and to put that into an example. Imagine you're in a conversation a round table with friends, and one of your friends Butts in with A with hey? Did I tell you about the craziest thing that ever happened to me.

173
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:23.809
Joden Newman: Now. Okay, there's a superlative. It's sensational, right? I I might perk up, you know. But it's no details, you know. It could be like, you know. There was 2 yolks in my eggs

174
00:30:24.281 --> 00:30:29.740
Joden Newman: which has happened to me, and was the craziest thing that happened to me. But now.

175
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:31.930
Joden Newman: instead, imagine they say this.

176
00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:44.910
Joden Newman: hey! Did you hear? About the time I was locked up in a Swiss prison for treason. Imagine it's the same story, but they've just presented it that way. They've pretty much given away all the details, but it raises way. More questions

177
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:48.839
Joden Newman: like 3. Specifically, you were locked up in a prison.

178
00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.550
Joden Newman: Why were you in Switzerland?

179
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.799
Joden Newman: How did you commit treason

180
00:30:53.030 --> 00:31:04.590
Joden Newman: and all the things in between? It creates more details, creates more gaps. So it's always be better to be explicit than implicit in a hook.

181
00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.699
Joden Newman: And a lot of people.

182
00:31:07.216 --> 00:31:12.369
Joden Newman: Don't realize that, you know. It's about giving as much away as possible.

183
00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:24.179
Joden Newman: Where it's still intrigued. You gotta think there's a there's like a point you're giving away giving away. And then, at a certain point, you're giving away too much. There's no video. But it's like finding that. How much can you say? Right?

184
00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.329
Joden Newman: So just to cover. We're still on context. We're still on hooks.

185
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:43.780
Joden Newman: Goodhook has clarity, context, simplicity, authority, detail and prompts questions, and some other considerations would be Goodhook is often recent. This just happened, or there's a visually implied payoff.

186
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.899
Joden Newman: you know, like a boulder rolling down a hill towards a target.

187
00:31:49.500 --> 00:32:16.627
Joden Newman: text. Hooks also can supplement what you're talking about. So a textbook, a text hook on screen. People read text quicker than here. So it's a good way to maybe supplement the hook to get more across or create more of a knowledge gap. And super important is energy. Yeah, you need to feel we're gonna cover that more. But you need to feel like you're you're talking to a friend like you're a real person, you know. Cool. So that's hooks.

188
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:28.572
Joden Newman: we're still on confusing. By the way. Now, you just need people to keep watching. So we're going to talk about how making script right and clear, making it clear why people need to keep watching. So?

189
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.790
Joden Newman: yeah, it. Yeah. Keeping your video clear, easy to understand, reaffirming all the things you set up in the hook. Simply put

190
00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:51.749
Joden Newman: hook them again again and again, and again. It's a very simple approach to script writing, the second that you deliver on a promise. The viewer is gone, the second they've got what they wanted from you. They're gone. There's nothing keeping them down. So there's sort of 2

191
00:32:52.094 --> 00:33:07.600
Joden Newman: scripting devices will use. You know, a lot of people say, you know, like they'll have these really advanced systems from like Hollywood. We think there's just 2 and you know script will be a series of these things. So one is rehooking.

192
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:16.979
Joden Newman: This is when you satisfy the initial hook a little bit too early on people feel they get the point they start to go rehooking is saying, no, no.

193
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:30.910
Joden Newman: that was, that was nothing. This is the thing you actually want to see, and then they up the ante. It's about rejecting and increasing. So an example would be, but that is completely useless without knowing this thing

194
00:33:31.524 --> 00:33:55.200
Joden Newman: and then really more simple, one would be like, but wait, it gets better or but wait, it gets worse. You know, the very Mr. Beast stuff, you know. We blew up one orphanage, but now we've blown up hundreds, that it's the it's the whatever you hook them in earlier. Have a bigger thing, and then rehook them with that, and if you hook them in with your biggest thing, then well.

195
00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.090
Joden Newman: probably make your video a bit shorter.

196
00:33:59.370 --> 00:34:14.790
Joden Newman: Then the other. The other things curiosity loop. So this is more opening as you open a series of these, and they don't all open and close at the same time they sort of weave throughout your video. And the more you have open the more retention, you know, audience is going to stay.

197
00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:19.509
Joden Newman: So I think of it sort of as teasing more stuff to come.

198
00:34:20.006 --> 00:34:41.830
Joden Newman: So an example would be, and I did it without wearing any trousers. But we'll get to that, because, you know. And then another example is, you've got your 1st topic. But before I can talk about that really intriguing thing, I just said, I have to explain this other intriguing thing. It's like making sure people are aware there's like all stuff

199
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:57.449
Joden Newman: to come. It's very, you know. You'll see it all the time on Youtube. But it's very, you know, the the simple to do is just like, think of 2 interesting things and say, but before I can talk about that. I have to explain this, and then that implies a relationship as well, which is intriguing

200
00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:14.450
Joden Newman: some script writing pro tips simplify your language always. Yeah, you just want to be really, really, really clear. That's for 2 reasons as well. That's for the audience. They might have a low reading comprehension.

201
00:35:14.650 --> 00:35:23.679
Joden Newman: But it's also for yourself. You have to say these words, and when you get in front of a camera and start speaking, your you know your mouth is full of

202
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:50.020
Joden Newman: a little jelly, so, you know, go easy on yourself, and the other is to this is something we found. Clash, remove commas really improves flow, especially if you work with clients who are reading off of a teleprompter. So, like, you know, you have a tendency to write more complex sentences, or just put in more commas by removing the commas, you end up simplifying all of your scripts. It's really interesting.

203
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.179
Joden Newman: Rioca was an amazing.

204
00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.268
Joden Newman: You said it and feel free to use it.

205
00:35:56.810 --> 00:36:02.280
Joden Newman: But yeah, if you and even if a comma is grammatically correct somewhere, I would still

206
00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:26.969
Joden Newman: still take it out because you read commas. It's just about what's going to flow best when you're reading off the teleprompter, or you're reading off the the script to the side of you. Yeah. Another one is a bit of an extreme extremist one, but like early on, cut all your scripts in half, or record them. But cut all your videos in half afterwards, because I guarantee you they're 50% fluff

207
00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:50.840
Joden Newman: you know, everything needs to have a purpose. Everything, you know. Audiences are getting lower and lower. Attention spans to cut everything in half. Really, really, you know, it's a thing in script, right? Screen screenplay writing. The old kill your babies, you know. You might really like that bit. But is it necessary? remember as well when scripting you're going to have visuals, so don't.

208
00:36:50.840 --> 00:37:01.120
Joden Newman: Nothing has to be said. If it's going to go through and edit, remember, you can show a picture of something without saying something. Always remember visuals and put in little editors. Notes

209
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:03.799
Joden Newman: cool. That was that. Okay.

210
00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:06.729
Joden Newman: that was a very long one. So

211
00:37:07.207 --> 00:37:17.639
Joden Newman: I wasn't lying and then the 3rd cardinal sin is being corporate. This really bad on Tiktok, slash insta slash Facebook.

212
00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:26.489
Joden Newman: So this is all about delivery, delivery and relatability. It's about how you speak and how you come across performance matters.

213
00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:28.980
Joden Newman: So what is being corporate.

214
00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:45.550
Joden Newman: salesy, inauthentic, disingenuous, and just a general feeling like no one's really home. And you're just being fed top of funnel ad copy. And you're just it's just trying to sell you something.

215
00:37:46.042 --> 00:37:50.980
Joden Newman: Yeah, I know that's exactly what we're doing. But it shouldn't feel like it

216
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:53.040
Joden Newman: anyway. Authenticity

217
00:37:54.366 --> 00:38:00.609
Joden Newman: so authenticity is all about being on the audience's level. It's the opera opera

218
00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.269
Joden Newman: opposite to being corporate.

219
00:38:05.173 --> 00:38:23.826
Joden Newman: Authenticity will mostly come through delivery like it's being authentic is not really something you can script. It's a way you talk, you know. So some people go. Oh, it's it's a short form. It's for the kids, and they just start Mr. Beast shouting, and it's that's not all. It's not that's not real

220
00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:38.369
Joden Newman: or they go very presentry. These are the top 5, and it's like calm down and then another thing, and this is a hard one to not do, especially, you know, no one's per, you know, getting camera

221
00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:55.440
Joden Newman: comfortable. It's very hard thing to do, but having weird body language ripping the table, or you know I have a thing where I'll play with my beards like I'm trying to rip it out, you know. It's like making sure you know where your hands are and putting them somewhere normal.

222
00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:14.169
Joden Newman: seriously, and then because when you speak, basically when you're speaking to a camera, your brain's not thinking I'm speaking to a person. It's thinks I'm alone, and you'd start doing all these weird things with your body. So you want to speak into your phone or your camera like you're on facetime or zoom to a friend.

223
00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:16.880
Joden Newman: That is the best way to do it.

224
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:30.200
Joden Newman: Every one of your scripts should be said like that. Speak how you're speaking to a friend when you get really excited to tell them, saying, Hey, oh, did I tell you about the this thing. Well, that's your hook, you know. Yeah, that's authenticity

225
00:39:31.178 --> 00:39:38.350
Joden Newman: cool some tips for authentic delivery. So go line by line, you know. Read a line.

226
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:50.810
Joden Newman: process it in your head. Say it in a way that sounds comfortable, and then just edit it altogether. Another one we do in house when we're writing scripts, and they're just coming across to corporate. Well.

227
00:39:50.850 --> 00:40:13.063
Joden Newman: will digest the information. And then, just like, explain the video to each other like, Oh, this is about, you know. Like like it was the 1st time the others hearing about it. So it's like, Oh, Oreo has a $50,000 cookie like by, like supreme teamed up with, or, you know, find the natural cadence, and then write a script that's closer to that.

228
00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:29.229
Joden Newman: Repeat lines before film. Yeah, just being prepared. Shout your lines, whisper your lines, talk in an accent, you know. Expect retakes. No one is a natural@firstst In fact, everyone is very far from it.

229
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:49.639
Joden Newman: How close should you be to the camera? That depends on how wide the angle of your lenses. But it really doesn't matter. I would say to that. If you're using a phone camera, then you should be quite close, because that's what's not. If you're using an inside camera, whereas if you're on a professional camera setup

230
00:40:49.972 --> 00:41:00.270
Joden Newman: I would be further away. Do you ever memorize the lines? I don't. I don't expect any of my clients to this is all about like creating content for busy

231
00:41:00.834 --> 00:41:03.679
Joden Newman: entrepreneurs people, you know, and like

232
00:41:04.194 --> 00:41:10.735
Joden Newman: memorizing lines. When you've got a teleprompter, you got script, and there are only 1 min videos

233
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:21.379
Joden Newman: to be to be fair. If you could memorize your lines they probably come out a lot better. But once again, a lot a big thing you got way up with short form content is how much time it's going to take

234
00:41:21.743 --> 00:41:34.106
Joden Newman: so just real quick 2 min break. And then we're gonna move on to the high level strategy. Yeah, we're past our halfway point. I just need to go grab some water

235
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:41.039
Joden Newman: everyone. Stretch your legs. I don't want anyone getting deep. Vein thrombosis on my watch. I hope that's okay, Josh.

236
00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:43.470
Joden Newman: I will be back very quickly.

237
00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.250
Josh Sanders: Anyone else. Finding this incredibly entertaining.

238
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.870
Emanuel Theander: Yeah.

239
00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:01.880
Josh Sanders: Honestly. His his level of thinking is is so so cool.

240
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:03.630
Josh Sanders: absolutely amazes me.

241
00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:06.040
Josh Sanders: It's fascinating as well.

242
00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:12.240
Luke Smolinski: It was the 2 egg yolks that got me going. I was like it was like, that's the most interesting thing that's ever happened to me.

243
00:42:13.830 --> 00:42:14.399
Joden Newman: Yeah, it's.

244
00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.890
Josh Sanders: I mean, it's impressive.

245
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:21.886
Joden Newman: I I told everyone about that that I knew. I think I even called my Nan. It's crazy.

246
00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.753
Luke Smolinski: It's brilliant.

247
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.463
Josh Sanders: He needs all these flavors.

248
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.550
Joden Newman: Are we ready to crack on because there's got?

249
00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:32.620
Joden Newman: I've got slides to get through, and I'm excited about it.

250
00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:33.780
Josh Sanders: Okay.

251
00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:49.200
Joden Newman: Fantastic. Okay, cool. I hope everyone's knees are stretched and they're ready for high level strategy made easy. So just to be retention optimized, this is going to cover 9 points, all at the top of the screen there. And yeah.

252
00:42:49.440 --> 00:43:10.309
Joden Newman: number one 1st is going to be your avatar. Now you're going to probably know a little bit about your avatar and what you're trying to achieve. But with short form you want to think about who you're trying to reach specifically. And then also who you're trying to reach broadly because the broad people will bring up the you in the algorithm and get more of the specific

253
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:27.478
Joden Newman: people. So think about, you know, kind of think about both. And then also what you're trying to get out of them. And then, most importantly, because I have been on discovery calls where we found out that the target demographic just isn't on the short form platforms. So make sure they are.

254
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:42.410
Joden Newman: yeah. So to go over the platforms. Pros. Cons the value in each of them. Xyz Linkedin's not on here. Because it's too new, and I haven't tested it enough to know about it.

255
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:54.209
Joden Newman: But all the others are so tick tock. I need to full screen this to be able to read. It pros much, much quicker growth. They've got a great algorithm, which means you get wider awareness, much, much quicker.

256
00:43:54.687 --> 00:44:08.279
Joden Newman: Plus the Creator Fund is probably the best out of all shorts revenue share, at least from what I know. But I do know in the States. I think you can monetize Instagram in a different way.

257
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:23.250
Joden Newman: Cons, low return viewers follow basically doesn't mean anything on Tiktok people. The only way they come back is by you making another viral video a lot of the time. It's very hard to build a fan base.

258
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:51.959
Joden Newman: And there's very few conversion tools. Now, this is very annoying people don't use the stories. People don't DM on Tiktok. So there's very few places to sell. And it sometimes seems like the Algorithm doesn't like it. When you do link in bio, so some tips would be story driven. Content does well on Tiktok, raw, authentic, you know. Long, you know. Get ready with me while I tell you about my toxic ex-boyfriend

259
00:44:51.990 --> 00:45:04.889
Joden Newman: does well, and then yes, so, and then authentic Lo-fi raw, you know, like on Tiktok. You really don't need a nice setup. You just need a phone, a camera and some riz

260
00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:13.679
Joden Newman: And then, yeah, general strategy with Tiktok is, you want to use that awareness that's so easy to generate to pollinate your other platforms.

261
00:45:14.492 --> 00:45:25.120
Joden Newman: Moving on to Youtube shorts. So the pros are the short you can directly in the video link to a long form.

262
00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:36.630
Joden Newman: a long form post. So it works really good. If you have a long form strategy plus Youtube, search is the second most used search engine in the world, and your shorts are going to appear there.

263
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:42.839
Joden Newman: Good stuff means get your SEO down. The cons are at least, I've

264
00:45:43.300 --> 00:46:08.340
Joden Newman: no, that's a mistake. The low return viewers is not a con ignore. That sorry, serious shadow bans is a con. What I found is on multiple accounts uploading more than one or 2 shorts a day. You just put yourself at risk. If they decide that they don't like you, that you know they're very, very bot aware.

265
00:46:08.686 --> 00:46:20.109
Joden Newman: They'll put you on a little shadow ban, which all the platforms will do. It's fine. But on Youtube it genuinely lasted, for in every instance like 3 or 4 months, which is

266
00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:29.790
Joden Newman: heavy if you rely on it for traffic. So shorts is you know, and maybe it's changed.

267
00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:40.769
Joden Newman: I would say. Another con of shorts is that it's only 1 min, but I think they're moving up to 3 now. Which I've heard, but not directly

268
00:46:41.173 --> 00:47:03.349
Joden Newman: played around with yet tips. So clip content does very well, especially when promoting larger long form videos think trailers clip hangers all of that but I would say, as I said, like, stick to one per day. Keep the limit low. You know. Make sure they're good ones. I I would keep your short strategy primarily to

269
00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:10.849
Joden Newman: promoting your long form platform, and if you don't have a long form platform, then just treating it like another Tiktok. Instagram.

270
00:47:11.060 --> 00:47:36.269
Joden Newman: Cool. Yeah. Strategy drive viewers, long form videos. So Instagram, a lot of pros here, conversion tools. There are loads, many chat automation. I'm sure you all know about that. That is a gift from God. When it comes to conversion, more return viewers. Yeah. So when people follow you, you actually do appear in their feed sometimes not guaranteed. But you you do

271
00:47:36.609 --> 00:47:41.360
Joden Newman: but yeah, you can convert in Dms, you can convert on stories. It's amazing

272
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:54.560
Joden Newman: cons slower growth, and many people might disagree, it might be. Oh, I blew up on Instagram, but reliable overall. The accounts I've overseen and grown like Instagram has been more of a slog.

273
00:47:55.666 --> 00:47:56.603
Joden Newman: Reliably.

274
00:47:57.830 --> 00:48:11.250
Joden Newman: so. But that really is the only con I can think of it. Another that comes up quite a lot with clients. Is that they have all their friends on Instagram, so they find it very cringe to post there.

275
00:48:11.627 --> 00:48:27.879
Joden Newman: So I guess that's a con as well. Tips. Yes, hi-fi! People like hi-fi stuff well produced stuff edutainment is going to do a lot better. People actually are a little bit there to learn, not like Linkedin, but definitely more than Tiktok.

276
00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:51.600
Joden Newman: Another huge tip for Instagram is, be very, very visual, you may have noticed, but it's muted by default, which is a weird choice. But so if you're, you've got the best hook in the world and you're saying it. Well, by the time someone's turned on the audio you've stopped, and they don't know why they should watch. So Instagram, content really think about being visual text on screen.

277
00:48:51.750 --> 00:49:04.859
Joden Newman: you know, more clear basically. And the strategy reels drive awareness and your stories and Dms convert. And then Facebook, which I'm sure everyone's very excited about

278
00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:25.370
Joden Newman: very specific demographic is a pro and then there's a variety of things so you can do reels. You can do long form. You can do posts, you can do articles. It's a bit of an everything platform cons, anything it can do for a business. Really, usually Instagram can do better.

279
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:52.460
Joden Newman: at least in organic. And it's kind of an unmoderated AI wasteland at the moment, and it's having a bit of an identity crisis as a platform. So tips, I would say, if you're trying to reach the 30. The old demographics think more TV. There's less influencer culture I've noticed on Facebook reels. Influencer things do worse. But clips will do better. Think of things that you send to your.

280
00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.340
Joden Newman: You know you're a

281
00:49:54.560 --> 00:50:19.383
Joden Newman: your alcoholic sort of uncle figure in your life or the stuff he sends you. That's that's reels. Facebook reels. Yeah. Strategy honestly reaching 35, 55 s. And just also just being more present in more locations. You may have a specific demographic. That is more on Facebook, and in those instances say it's like mums, or

282
00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:33.700
Joden Newman: well, say, it's mums. Then that's going to be the place you. You want your strategy to be okay. Cool moving on to pillars you'll have pillars, I'm sure. These are just the tenets of your brand, the mission statements.

283
00:50:34.150 --> 00:51:03.229
Joden Newman: So one example, a fitness instructor trying to reach a novice slash beginner, gym goers. Their pillars might be advocating for fit, curious average Joes, rejecting toxic high intensity, fitness, culture, motivating people to work out and stay consistent and balancing fitness with family. You know, this is these aren't video ideas. These are just the tenets. These are the things that promote. It relates to their product and their avatar.

284
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.020
Joden Newman: And yeah, it's there like

285
00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.290
Joden Newman: core beliefs.

286
00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:18.869
Joden Newman: So look, let's let's have a little go at this one. What could be the pillars for a relationship expert trying to reach women who struggle to date?

287
00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.599
Joden Newman: What might be some pillars

288
00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:34.491
Joden Newman: date nightmares. Yep, yep, 100 yeah. Or like toxic exes. Kind of kind of thing. Evil

289
00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:41.830
Joden Newman: mindset. Yeah, yeah, you know. Be self-sufficient, self-sustainable

290
00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:44.290
Joden Newman: lack of trust in guys.

291
00:51:44.610 --> 00:51:57.749
Joden Newman: Yeah, it would depend on her product. If the product's a weapon that kills men, then, yeah, where to find the best places to. Yeah. So the more like, where you know how to date the right things to date. Like.

292
00:51:57.750 --> 00:52:25.649
Joden Newman: Yeah, no, those are all all really good ideas. They align very much with what I got challenging the narrative and relationship stereotypes. I think this person would be highlighting example of toxic boyfriends, partners. There you go, Josh, harm, reduction and awareness for women around toxic men, or you know all those dangers and advocating, for I can't remember who said this, but emotional and financial independence in women.

293
00:52:25.650 --> 00:52:50.790
Joden Newman: Those would be the pillars. Not necessarily videos, right? And then, okay, next, high level strategy. You need to know who are your allies now? I I would call this competitors. But I everyone's all so nice these days. So I thought we could all get along. But yeah. Bottom line. There will be people doing what you want to be doing, making the content you want to make, and they'll be doing it better. So find them.

294
00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:54.129
Joden Newman: Learn what topics work and what topics don't

295
00:52:54.590 --> 00:53:15.259
Joden Newman: cool. Then we move on to content buckets. So your buckets are created by taking your pillars, cross, referencing it with your competitors, who you found the best topics from, and combining them with popular formats, which we talked a bit about earlier. So getting your pillars, you know, looking at competitors in the same sort of spaces. What

296
00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:28.834
Joden Newman: things are they talking about that doing? Well? And then, okay, you're gonna talk about that. But you're gonna do it in this format or this format that does really well. And then those are your buckets. You'll have like 3 or 4 buckets that you're trying at any one time.

297
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:56.919
Joden Newman: yeah. And you're yeah. Here's something I wrote formats like the language each platform speaks in. So there, some formats do more well on Instagram, on Tiktok, and like language, it evolves all the time. So make sure you're keeping things fresh. So with our fitness structure. Example. I thought buckets could be top 10 lists for easy workouts. Healthy needs meal suggestions. That's a format. The top 5

298
00:53:57.287 --> 00:54:15.509
Joden Newman: with, you know, a topic, stitches slash, reacts a format to bad advice green screen with before and afters before and after is kind of a format of like, you know people unhealthy become healthy. And then, yeah, like day day in my life, productivity hacks. How I manage

299
00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.390
Joden Newman: being healthy

300
00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:46.350
Joden Newman: and getting my work done like, you know, it's just the formats plus the pillars, plus the research. And then you want to go on to this, the prevalidated content, which I'm sure is a word we've all heard lots of, but it's the idea that you don't. With those buckets, with everything. You don't need to be reinventing the wheel, and especially early on your account. You want that growth. You've probably read the book steal like an artist. I haven't, but I like what it's called.

301
00:54:46.350 --> 00:55:01.399
Joden Newman: and I think it's relevant. There's no need to reinvent the wheel when it comes to ideation. You know, you want to research what everyone's doing and find proven concepts both in your niche and in different niches, and you can just

302
00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:22.209
Joden Newman: take out what worked plug and play yourself. What you're doing there is remixing. There's no such thing as an original idea. You know, every great piece of work is a remix of a couple other things. It's that old video. Everything's a remix. Then, if anyone saw that but that that's my point. I'm stealing it

303
00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.570
Joden Newman: cool.

304
00:55:23.952 --> 00:55:44.869
Joden Newman: This is important. This is something I've fallen into several times, and still do I call it the tip of the iceberg trap. And it comes in the research phases. And it's kind of 2 prongs it can happen for individual videos that you you're thinking of prevalidated and accounts that are in your niche. So this is an iceberg.

305
00:55:44.870 --> 00:56:00.279
Joden Newman: So you got a video that looks prevalidated up here 3.2 million views. Wow! I should do that. But what you're not seeing is that it was posted over a year ago wouldn't do well now, or the comments are all talking about something. That's not the point. Maybe there was a mistake in it.

306
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:17.709
Joden Newman: or it was related to a trend that no longer exists, or the reach was paid for, which you usually tell by looking at the engagement numbers. They won't. They'll be disproportionate to the views, or this is a bit of tough love. Sometimes the Creator's looks slash. Riz is

307
00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:25.599
Joden Newman: going to be the gonna be the reason something went viral, you know, and you might be like, Oh, but I'm

308
00:56:25.650 --> 00:56:31.790
Joden Newman: you know it's sometimes it is just who they are. They're the right type of demographic to do a certain video, you know.

309
00:56:32.438 --> 00:56:35.470
Joden Newman: Like I. I don't think I'd get the

310
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:54.010
Joden Newman: a lot of views on like fenty makeup reviews. Kind of thing right then, for follower account for accounts. You see the content they post now, you see, they have 320,000 followers, but really they originally grew on another platform. Their recent videos are flopping. They haven't grown in 2 years.

311
00:56:54.010 --> 00:57:18.149
Joden Newman: Their account used to be completely different, and the all the entire account grew just from one Mega Viral video that they've not managed to repeat. So these are all things you can start copying people that don't actually know what they're doing because you're looking at the numbers, but not looking at why those numbers are there. So it's about understanding, not just went viral what went viral and copying it. But making sure you're copying the reason it went viral.

312
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.950
Joden Newman: So takes a little bit of analysis.

313
00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:39.930
Joden Newman: and then we'll go. Yeah. So then you want, then it's all about adapting, it's about iterating, iterating something works, do it again, but better change it, tweak it. Look your analytics. If something doesn't work, try it again. Try again. Try again, scrap it. You know it's that adaptation you want to evolve as you're making content.

314
00:57:39.930 --> 00:58:01.230
Joden Newman: And then this is the sort of 3 tiered approach. This is this isn't a strict guideline. It does help. Early on you want your broad, your focused and your niche content. Your broad content is going to be for everyone. It's going to be your bigger videos. It's going to be the ones that go more viral. And it's going to get you views. So push you up in the algorithm. And it's going to get you followers.

315
00:58:01.805 --> 00:58:31.430
Joden Newman: You're more focused content. That's gonna be the bulk of it. That's where you're going to talk about the things that are actually interested to you. Interesting to you. They'll have high engagement, probably won't go as far, but they're really good for basically conversions and making people aware of products and just strengthen that connection. Now then, there's your mega niche content. This will be stuff that's like very personal or or very raw or or just like super technical and niche. And this isn't about growth

316
00:58:31.430 --> 00:59:01.039
Joden Newman: or conversion. But what this is about. I guess it's all about conversion at the end of the day, but this is about forming. People who watch this niche content will start to form more of that parasocial relationship. This is about forming a deeper connection with your audience. So. And if you just want to get as big as possible as fast as possible. Then just do broad content. But most accounts will look like this to have a healthy growth and conversion and connection with their audience. So now.

317
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:28.600
Joden Newman: how does it all convert? Let's talk about conversion. So 1st followers just gonna basically go through some Ccas and some rough best practices. So, followers, drop me a follow if you like this, please follow. Remember who you heard it from. Follow. The main thing is putting the call to action, and this kind of applies to all of them before you satisfy the hook. So before you give them that final nugget, even if it's right in the middle of the video or near the start

318
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:42.410
Joden Newman: just saying it before they're gone. That's really really important. You'll get followers if you tuck it at the end. But if you put it at the end, you'll not only get less followers, but your retention will be lower and you'll get less views. As a result.

319
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:54.610
Joden Newman: Instagram. This is not something people often think about converting to, but if you think about it, Instagram converts like 5 times more than it like Tiktok right? Or the others. So

320
00:59:54.988 --> 01:00:24.281
Joden Newman: it would make sense to send people to your Instagram when they're already following you on other platforms. So one thing to do. Yeah. So I've seen a good way to do this is have a part, one on Tiktok, or Part 2 on Instagram, or make sure you're following on Instagram for the behind the scenes, or where I break down this, you know it's a good way of getting your more engaged audience over to Instagram, where you can then sell them through Dms and Manychat and all those things.

321
01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:28.860
Joden Newman: yeah, Newsletter, the Holy Grail of

322
01:00:29.868 --> 01:00:37.040
Joden Newman: funnels. So this is about anytime. You make anything valuable. Saying something like

323
01:00:37.339 --> 01:01:04.520
Joden Newman: I put this all and more in my free newsletter comment, this link, and I'll send it to you. Newsletter is gonna work best with the lead magnet, and when it comes to a lead lead magnet, just it's all about making an educational video that you go. Oh, you want this written down. I've written it down, that's all. A lead magnet needs to be ideally once again, not at the end of the video. But yeah, many chat is kind of going to be the best for newsletter podcast

324
01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:32.260
Joden Newman: clips and trailers are going to push it the best. It's very hard, because this is you're going to struggle here. Same with the next one. It's long form pushing long form on short form is an uphill struggle. For obvious reasons. People are here for 30 second clips, and you're saying, Hey, listen to my 2 h long. It's hard. It's a tough sell. So things like clips and trailers work very well. They're like need to know more, you know. Die over CEO. Been so good at that

325
01:01:32.572 --> 01:01:48.529
Joden Newman: but or like, you can, you know, have videos where you talk about what happened on the podcast just going to move on to Youtube, because, I have a similar point for both of them. Youtube, unless you're doing shorts where you can go click here for the full video.

326
01:01:49.020 --> 01:02:12.009
Joden Newman: you know, and directly link to the long form. It's gonna be the same struggle of like having a sort of trailer or a video that talks about something, and then says, if you want to know the rest? It's in this place. I would say, like general advice. It's easier to get people to through a through a link tree

327
01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:38.440
Joden Newman: to subscribe to a podcast or subscribe to a Youtube channel than it is to get them to go watch a video, and then they might watch the video. If that makes sense, if it if you can call to action it in a way that seems genuine, you know, like, Oh, please, you know, just like, follow my podcast where this far away like, if you like my content, you know, to get them to do the button click is oftentimes going to be easier than to get them to do the the 2 h. Sit down.

328
01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:47.983
Joden Newman: But yeah, those 2 are tricky. But yeah, with news and also paid community or free community. I know a lot of people are on

329
01:02:48.700 --> 01:03:16.329
Joden Newman: many chat automation. Once again. Comment this. I'll send you a thing a good thing to do is, you know, set the value of the thing really, really high. So it's like, these are 20 lessons I learned by paying 40,000 to mentors. And I'm giving it to you for free. And people feel like they're getting 40 grand like, that's that's just yeah thoughts and call to actions. But yeah, many chats going to be the best on Tiktok and everything else you have to do. The old Lincoln bio thing, which is a little bit rough.

330
01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:31.419
Joden Newman: viral hacking. Now, this is the fun stuff. Supposedly. It's also the ethically, morally dubious stuff. But let's yeah, let's just go through it. So what is viral hacking?

331
01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:44.400
Joden Newman: So remember the holistic approach I outlined earlier the 1st principles. Yeah, this well, with viral hacking. You kind of want to just get that. And

332
01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:49.810
Joden Newman: yeah, just throw it all away. Because

333
01:03:49.810 --> 01:04:09.389
Joden Newman: with viral hacking the growth hackers, holy Trinity is comments, shares and retention, and nothing else matters. There's no art, there's no soul. It's about these 3 things right here, and you can even take that down to 2 things. Commenting makes people watch longer and shares, gets more people to watch. So really, they affect retention, anyway.

334
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:20.610
Joden Newman: So then it's viral hackings. How do you pinpoint these 2 things in your videos. And I'll say, whenever we're struggling, whenever we have accounts, slow down.

335
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:25.180
Joden Newman: always go back to the basics. What are we doing to get comments and shares?

336
01:04:26.017 --> 01:04:37.839
Joden Newman: And we'll find oh, not enough. So what makes people comment? The feeling of? I need to say this, and then the feeling of. I really want to say this, that one's a bit harder.

337
01:04:37.840 --> 01:05:04.380
Joden Newman: I need to say this comes from incompleteness. It comes from having to correct some misinformation or a mistake you made. It's usually angry. It's usually defending. It's what we're probably all familiar with in comment sections. And but engagements engagement. Right? But yeah. So you would stoke this by doing something wrong and not addressing it. The important thing is not addressing it. It's leaving the something unsaid. I have to say something

338
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:19.720
Joden Newman: I really want to say this. So this is about showing off this about you know. Making a joke, you know, or it's about starting conversation, you know, like you're giving your audience a chance to, you know.

339
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.479
Joden Newman: Show themselves.

340
01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:44.729
Joden Newman: Yeah, exactly. And I'm sure we've all done that exact one. You go. Number 4, this thing number 2. And where's number 3? View Skyrocket, like those little things? Yeah. And there's so many levels, you can take that to but yeah, I really want to say, this is bit harder. But starting that conversation give people an opportunity to add something of their own. Yeah.

341
01:05:45.332 --> 01:05:57.609
Joden Newman: so with, I need to say, this, here's a great example this video has 16 million views. It's just like what I I can't read it, but making my

342
01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:07.500
Joden Newman: husband food the most disgusting salty meal in the world. It is enraging. Let me full. Screen it

343
01:06:08.447 --> 01:06:20.200
Joden Newman: chips and beans after his 9 h. And you can see we've got 45,000 comments, 19 million views. And it's just some food in a pan, because it's so enraging.

344
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:34.440
Joden Newman: And then we've got. I really want to say this, and this is the more nice one. But with growth. Hacking, being nice is always harder than creating hate. And that's as a short form. Creator. That's your moral.

345
01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:57.749
Joden Newman: That's what you know. That's your moral duty, right, anyway. Yeah. So here's here's 1 i saw the other day. Love it. Batman got his name from his fear of bats using the same logic. What's your superhero name. It's just a really obvious example of people engaged because they want to say balls man and my dad man, and things like that. And that got 3 million views on

346
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:59.962
Joden Newman: on Instagram reels.

347
01:07:01.170 --> 01:07:06.879
Joden Newman: yeah, those were my comments as well on it. Those were the ones I left the ones. I just said,

348
01:07:07.470 --> 01:07:20.399
Joden Newman: what makes people share? Okay, so this is, I think this is one. People get a little bit tough. It's like, why, why share anything once again broken it down into 2 main reasons. I want credit. I want connections

349
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:42.479
Joden Newman: I want credit is like a child saying, Look at this shiny rock I found. Isn't it so shiny? I found it. It's you want to show people saying that's funny or relatable or interesting, but it's about having the look at this cool thing I found. Doesn't that make you think of me? And we're friends? That's why people share things. And then the other side

350
01:07:42.640 --> 01:08:12.076
Joden Newman: is the and also with very sorry with the credit thing. Another huge one is, remember that argument we were having. This is what I was trying to say when we were 3 pints deep, this is the argument I was trying to make. I'm smart with more like opinionated ones that's going to be. Why, Sank will get a lot of shares. So just think about that. The I want credit. I want connection. It's just this made me think of you so you can. You can hack this by making sure you're relating to

351
01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:42.230
Joden Newman: you know, big pop culturey things that lots of people in, you know if you're talking about films or talking about specific film, or talking about things with fandoms, or you know, certain sports, it's like, Hey, you're into this, aren't you? Or if you're talking about trends, a big reason trends go by. If you've got some like update on the trend, it's like, because a lot of people are sharing, going. We were just talking about this. So it's like reminding people of other people or creating some. It's it's basically

352
01:08:42.229 --> 01:09:09.299
Joden Newman: what are people talking about, and how come, you know, when they see this? They go. We were just saying that and then the others like, What's something that like. For example, I did a video that went really, really big. And it got taken down. But it went really, really big, initially because it talked about the 1st thing it talked about was the movie old boy, which is a Korean film which is like

353
01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:31.549
Joden Newman: kind of the most widely known niche film. So it's like something that a lot of people feel like they're the only one who knows about it. But actually it's huge and shares upon shares and tags in the comments. Hey, that's that film you like, you know. So it's about finding the niche, not niche will get shares. But yeah, those

354
01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:34.237
Joden Newman: that's kind of how shares work.

355
01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.120
Joden Newman: yeah.

356
01:09:36.430 --> 01:09:53.410
Joden Newman: to stoke shares. Talk about saying friends are talking about off platform, what people talking about cool. We're going to go into some individual hacks real quick that you can use one we've already covered this. Get it wrong. You know Corey's world is a great example. He's always messing things up.

357
01:09:53.859 --> 01:10:22.680
Joden Newman: And he's grown so much purely from just making a mistake in pretty much every video hack 2 is tapping into a culture war you would have seen stuff like this, you know. It's like boys versus girls left versus right vegans versus meat eaters, the the stuff that, like teenagers, are insecure about on the Internet like, even if you just talk about something adjacent, you can start an argument in the comments, not saying it's ethical.

358
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:38.947
Joden Newman: I said that weird but I am saying it does. It does boost things. You know. So anything political like that? Will. Yeah. Viewer tangibility. Now this is one I personally have an example of.

359
01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:45.460
Joden Newman: for every follower I got. I ate a bean, and the the thinking for that was, it's about

360
01:10:46.000 --> 01:11:11.059
Joden Newman: giving meaning to engaging with the content like this is why a lot of people a lot of people, do giveaways for the same reason you engage with this, and you get a chance at something. You affect the world tangibly with your engagement. You know what I said in these videos was, Follow me, and I will eat one bean because of you. And then, you know, I had 7,000 followers the next day and never ate a baked bean again.

361
01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:28.340
Joden Newman: yeah. Hack 4 is the watch along I've got. You probably know him. But hack 4 is just like finding things that are really viral, putting them in a compilation, and just watching them with people keeping people company while you show them something good example. I don't know how well

362
01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.720
Joden Newman: this stuff plays.

363
01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:32.610
Joden Newman: No.

364
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:42.219
Joden Newman: you've all seen that guy right? You know. He just plays some clips and

365
01:11:42.850 --> 01:12:02.649
Joden Newman: looks around. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But that's that's a watch. He's just he's just watching. Content with you, you know. Cool. And then, just to mention another thing. So if you once again classcreation.com forward slash masterclass, I do have 16 viral hacks that are in this like beautiful document.

366
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:19.109
Joden Newman: along with the slides to this presentation, if you go there, it will be available for 48 h, and there's some more of those unethical ones on there that I don't want to be promoting with my face. But yeah, plastercation.com slash masterclass, if you want more hacks.

367
01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:45.070
Joden Newman: thanks, Tia. And finally, how do you do it all? In 8 h of work a month. That's the important one. We're all busy people, right? We're all, you know, founders, executives, playboys, you know. We're busy. So we need to reduce the amount of time. How we do it, and the way we do that is batching. And

368
01:12:45.170 --> 01:13:06.639
Joden Newman: this is very exciting, I know, but like I'm just going to talk you through the batch process that I used both when I was a freelancer, and that we use now as an agency, and it works for if you have one employee, no employees, a million employees. It's just about keeping things clean. So I'm going to run through it really quick batch process. I'm going to go researching, writing, shooting, editing.

369
01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:10.349
Joden Newman: researching makes it bigger.

370
01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:33.439
Joden Newman: So step one, create the master. Doc. This is everything that you're interested in. Every every piece of video that you've looked at everything goes into this one. Doc always always put it here. It's a dump. You need the dump, Doc. Step 2. Make it make sense. You get that, Master Doc. And then you start bringing each one of those out into an actual video.

371
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:46.140
Joden Newman: So you can combine some similar ones, you know. And then you get the point, and then you take 20 ideas from say, step 2. So you get. Say, you left with 50 ideas. You take 20 of them. That's your 1st batch

372
01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:53.670
Joden Newman: then you make a new doc, and that's where you're gonna write your actual scripts, and you might, as you're scripting, come up with more

373
01:13:54.516 --> 01:14:07.519
Joden Newman: more ideas. And you script them. So yeah, for the script writing. Here's here's what we do. Here's the best. Don't make 20 different docs for 20 different videos. It's just bureaucracy.

374
01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.859
Joden Newman: For no reason. We everything in one, doc using the headers.

375
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:27.249
Joden Newman: So do 20 videos, a batch sort the batch into buckets and then color code each script with how well it's done, so that everyone along that. So you've got a writer they can communicate to you where a video is, and whether it's for you to review.

376
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:41.100
Joden Newman: Yeah, and then make sure you're including editor notes early on, because you're going to forget to put them in later, and then, for all those half ideas, put them at the bottom of the doc and bring them in next week. Now, shooting. I've got 2 examples here hopefully, cool.

377
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:49.629
Joden Newman: hopefully, without sound. So this is generally, if you if you've only got one freelancer videographer to come in. This was the sort of way

378
01:14:50.113 --> 01:14:55.620
Joden Newman: you set up. You get some lights around you. Boom! And you're done now

379
01:14:55.830 --> 01:15:02.610
Joden Newman: more these days you bought, you know. There's plenty of agencies where you'll come in. It'll be done

380
01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:12.540
Joden Newman: for you. But you have to go and travel somewhere. Those are the 2 ways people do it, or you might be doing it yourself, and in which case, I don't envy you.

381
01:15:13.182 --> 01:15:15.859
Joden Newman: But yeah, let's go on to shooting

382
01:15:16.134 --> 01:15:18.510
Joden Newman: so this one's yeah. This is some good stuff.

383
01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:41.490
Joden Newman: So having someone directing you is really important. This can be a partner, you know your husband or wife, or you know, this can be literally anyone but you're not going to be aware of when you're going static. And when you're being less personable. And all these things. So, having someone else there directing you, experienced or no super super useful.

384
01:15:41.792 --> 01:15:57.209
Joden Newman: Then just go script, script, script, script, script, script. Get that script done next script done. Next script done next. Easy change shirt every 3 or 4 videos. It looks just really bad on an account when someone's wearing the same green sheet T-shirt for like 3 weeks worth of content.

385
01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:19.029
Joden Newman: yeah. And right this is, this is important. If you have an editor that isn't there when you film, you want to write a camera log. A lot of you might have editors in the Philippines. I don't know. You want to write a camera log. Here's me writing a camera log while you film. So each time you turn the camera on bad, take good. Take use, hook from this. Take.

386
01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:31.439
Joden Newman: you know, for example, and then this, we've sort of covered this on performance before. So the handover, this is important. So you get that document. Let me just make that bit

387
01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.850
Joden Newman: sorry

388
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:51.610
Joden Newman: you get that document that you wrote during filming, and then you get some scientists to try and like. Figure out what you wrote, because your handwriting is so terrible. They realize the Rosetta Stone can translate it. And then you put this at the top of your script document for your editor to access.

389
01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:54.050
Joden Newman: true story.

390
01:16:54.516 --> 01:17:01.909
Joden Newman: Yeah. So yeah. Your camera log added to the top of the script document which your editor will access. Then, premiere pro

391
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:25.319
Joden Newman: this is, I won't bore you on the details, but all sequences get them all in projects, speed things right up and name everything the batch number, then the video number number everything like you can see around number everything, number all your files, or you'll lose stuff forever. And then let me just zoom in on this one. So if you use frame great, if not

392
01:17:25.668 --> 01:17:34.390
Joden Newman: you're missing out so you can see we can set the status who it's been approved by, where it's scheduled, where it's uploaded.

393
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:40.020
Joden Newman: who's responsible for it? And how well it performed. If it has been uploaded

394
01:17:40.644 --> 01:17:46.800
Joden Newman: and then you can put revisions right on the video, which is really good. Now, posting

395
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:53.512
Joden Newman: cool. I just tried to breeze through that, because that can be a bit boring. So posting best practice

396
01:17:55.450 --> 01:18:06.749
Joden Newman: post manually by hand, always schedulers none of the platforms like them. You have to post manually by hand, or find someone who you can pay to do it.

397
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:24.089
Joden Newman: Trust me if you're using a scheduler right now, and you're wondering why you only get 20 views. It's the reason you can still schedule things. A lot of apps have a manual schedule. So they send the video to your phone at the time you schedule it, and then you post it. That's all fine.

398
01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:42.996
Joden Newman: Try and use at least one feature of the app, whether that's a sound, their subtitles, a text box, or anything, even if you've edited outside the app just adding something. And this is all more the mysticism, superstition, part of it, but adding something. It does feel like the the platforms prefer

399
01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.960
Joden Newman: But I've got no hard evidence to back that up

400
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:58.900
Joden Newman: caption. Your video. Yeah. So captions really don't matter. But keywords just pump it full of keywords, basically, and hashtags. Same thing, just keywords that things don't really rank on

401
01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:18.850
Joden Newman: hashtags in the same way, it's more just the words you're using. So if you're doing really specific tutorials, then make sure that if someone searching for that really specific tutorial can find it. But in general it's just those keywords the algorithm knows what kind of audience to send it to. But ultimately it's making those decisions on like.

402
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:26.440
Joden Newman: you know the air. And like, you know, your deep brain. And you know they're so advanced.

403
01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:36.310
Joden Newman: yeah. And posting times everyone always. What time should I post? Generally doesn't matter but common sense post, just

404
01:19:36.530 --> 01:20:01.690
Joden Newman: before the time your audience is most awake and on their phone. So I like the Uk Evening American afternoon slot. You know. I think if a video is more educational I'll post it more in the afternoon, and generally it will perform better when people are like. Oh, I'm not procrastinating. And then like, when you're at 6 pm. And people just want to die and go to bed. That's when you you know, you get your more entertaining, broad content out.

405
01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:30.760
Joden Newman: And also a rule of rule. Never repost videos. Remake them. Algorithms hate it cool. And then there's just real quick on that. Who to hire and how to hire once again. classcreation.com forward slash, masterclass. I wanted to fit everything in this, but I've got we're 120 slides in. I could not. I'll send you this, which is basically a souped up internal document which we have on hiring and delegation. It works for one employee or tab that's there that's completely free.

406
01:20:31.334 --> 01:20:34.205
Joden Newman: That's the link. Cool,

407
01:20:34.900 --> 01:20:42.059
Joden Newman: And then I don't know what meth I was smoking when I did this. At least this is how we do it at clash creation

408
01:20:42.250 --> 01:20:44.170
Joden Newman: nailed that ending.

409
01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:53.154
Joden Newman: Yeah, cool that's that's my piece has anyone got any questions that ending sucked

410
01:20:54.180 --> 01:20:57.179
Josh Sanders: And that was amazing. Thank you so much. Firstly.

411
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:59.379
Joden Newman: Hi! Very welcome!

412
01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:20.372
Josh Sanders: I was I was writing down like so many questions as you were going through that. And then every question was like, you just ticked them off as you were going through like there was so much in there, so comprehensive. Yeah, thank you so much for for that. I think there was one question I personally had. I think also, Anna asked, as any sorry as well

413
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:30.400
Josh Sanders: in terms of like finding those creators you mentioned before, like in the research phase and things like that. What's your kind of strategy to find people who are hitting the same sort of topics as as you are.

414
01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:43.109
Joden Newman: So number one thing is like, why, when I, where I find the most interesting stuff is just like talking to people, and especially people who are in like completely different algorithms. To me.

415
01:21:43.464 --> 01:22:01.185
Joden Newman: like all everyone who works at the company like, we're all in completely different algorithms. So like it's about having open conversations with people that aren't into the same things. Then, okay, say, you have no friends that's totally totally fair. Neither do I? You can go on

416
01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:23.807
Joden Newman: the reels. Search on. Ticked on Instagram. It's got key. If you search a keyword, then go over to reels. Just scroll on there for ages. Eventually you'll find something you like and realize they have a whole channel dedicated to that. A lot of people will signpost what they do in their handle, which is super super easy. And then

417
01:22:24.150 --> 01:22:43.140
Joden Newman: it's just a matter of like I mean, sometimes some people. They'll make a burner account, and just what consume loads of that content. So they train an algorithm just to show them those people and show them those trends. But in in general I find conversations to be the best, because that's how you know.

418
01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:52.439
Joden Newman: Not only you know what who's in that niche who's interesting. But you also know who what's interesting about them, because the people you're talking to are.

419
01:22:52.510 --> 01:23:02.140
Joden Newman: I have watched and engaged with their content, so they will kind of know. So when they explain their content to you, they'll explain the good bits. So it kind of distills itself.

420
01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:15.539
Josh Sanders: Amazing. That makes sense. And I think a great question here from Manuel as well. And he was saying, next year he wants to grow his brand on Tiktok. And how can we stand out in a world that's dominated by big creators and teams?

421
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:40.510
Joden Newman: Very, very easily. The teams, big teams move slow. Individual creators move fast, and it's very much a meritocracy. And especially if you're talking Tiktok, you don't need you don't need a fancy thing. You just need to be the 1st person on a new story, and you've got a viral video. You've just got to be the 1st person.

422
01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:58.059
Joden Newman: You know. Yeah, reacting to something or you've just got. You know, you've just got to be more daring digging up an an old Reddit thread or something like you know, teams also have more collateral that can be damaged.

423
01:23:59.310 --> 01:24:18.729
Joden Newman: I think I use that word right? Whereas, like individuals, you can move quick. You can move really, really quick. And it's just like you can just go and find shocking things and say them whereas teams will often have missions and stay if if the goal is just pure growth. But I wouldn't. I would say there's no

424
01:24:18.730 --> 01:24:42.670
Joden Newman: disadvantage you have as an individual, besides capacity, so say if you set yourself to when you know as an individual, I would only post 3 times a week. I couldn't. I couldn't run a life and post like 7 times a week, you know, and work a job and build a company like it'd be impossible. So there's I, I'd say there's benefits to both. But you could. It's just about being

425
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:45.190
Joden Newman: on it. Basically.

426
01:24:45.690 --> 01:24:52.839
Josh Sanders: Love that? And Dora just said, can creators in their forties and fifties be successful on Tiktok, too? Or is it more suitable for younger generations.

427
01:24:53.050 --> 01:25:00.640
Joden Newman: I I think you actually have an advantage, because less people look like you like

428
01:25:00.690 --> 01:25:18.540
Joden Newman: on that platform is what I mean. You know I'm you know. I I don't know what you look like, but I'm assuming maybe you'd look a bit like you're 40 or 50, or maybe you look really good. But the point I'm making is like I was speaking recently, I did discovery call. We didn't end up working together with a psychologist.

429
01:25:18.825 --> 01:25:40.549
Joden Newman: Who's written a book on narcissism, and I said to him, I think that's really brilliant. I think you can really go far with that, because there's so many people talking about mental health on Tiktok. But even if they're a psychologist, it's like, Yeah, but you're 23. You don't. I don't believe you have the. But this was a 55 year old man, and when I talked earlier about that white coat syndrome.

430
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:42.809
Joden Newman: older people naturally.

431
01:25:43.150 --> 01:25:58.809
Joden Newman: You know, project more wisdom. Right. So if you're thinking about edutainment, you become much more reliable. And I all the time you'll see if you've got as long as you get it like as long as you. Maybe you need a Gen. Z. Intern

432
01:25:59.743 --> 01:26:03.776
Joden Newman: but as long as you get it you can

433
01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:25.679
Joden Newman: you you can totally do it like. If if anything, you're a huge, I think you're a huge advantage. If you know what you're doing right like. Think like like Mark tilbury is an example love. Mark's content his son gets it, and he's got the wisdom together. They they're massive, like. So at no disadvantage. I think.

434
01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:31.259
Josh Sanders: Love that love, that I also follow some random dude who talks about like old books, and he is like.

435
01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:31.740
Joden Newman: Yeah.

436
01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:36.499
Josh Sanders: And he has, like a funny like waistcoat, which makes him like so recognizable as well, so.

437
01:26:36.500 --> 01:26:40.231
Joden Newman: No, he's he's great. Yeah, I know. I don't know his name, but yeah, he's.

438
01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.180
Josh Sanders: 6 seconds!

439
01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:49.690
Joden Newman: The his age brings authenticity like young people, can't be authentic. They don't even know who they are, yet how can they project it?

440
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:55.720
Josh Sanders: Very true, very true. Emmanuel says if you were starting again from scratch, what setup would you invest in first.st

441
01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.219
Joden Newman: Sorry. What! What would I invest in.

442
01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:01.380
Josh Sanders: What setup would you invest in first? st

443
01:27:01.380 --> 01:27:14.849
Joden Newman: Oh, if you're talking about equipment. Of well, computer first, st if I had nothing oh, no phone first, st I guess in this, and then so it would go lights, audio camera.

444
01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.469
Joden Newman: So like a good key light.

445
01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:35.940
Joden Newman: Then a good good audio cause that really really matters. And then camera, because assuming you have a phone made in the last 6 years, you've got a good enough camera. And then, after that, personally, I'd buy more lights, because I like lights, as you can see.

446
01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:41.320
Josh Sanders: Love that. And then Luke says, to keep authenticity, would you recommend using screen prompts or freestyle with the script.

447
01:27:41.670 --> 01:28:06.630
Joden Newman: Yeah, we do that with them, with a lot, with with clients a lot. As like part of the strategy, we'll have ones that are free form. The problem is, that you you might do more takes because you might not stick the landing, start on a prompt, and then you go on a like, you know, we have a lot. We work with a lot of entrepreneurs, and they're all very taipe a. So they start talking, and then they just end up somewhere else. And then you go cut. And it's like.

448
01:28:06.630 --> 01:28:17.830
Joden Newman: yeah, that that was like 5 videos, you know. So I like it. I think it's really good. It's got pros. And cons, I think the best thing you're gonna get maybe is like an outline.

449
01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:30.909
Joden Newman: yeah. But once again. It just depends how you work. Some people they get in front of a camera. Their mind goes blank. They need the script where some people, once you got them warmed up.

450
01:28:30.930 --> 01:28:41.300
Joden Newman: they can just chat, and they're gonna talk better than they can ever write. So it really depends on really depends on like you. But like, yeah, good medium bullet points.

451
01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:50.919
Josh Sanders: That's nice. And Gpa. Says, when is the best time to branch onto Tiktok when you're currently growing an audience on Linkedin? Or how important is it to have an audience elsewhere? First.st

452
01:28:53.590 --> 01:29:06.840
Joden Newman: wait what? I'm confused by the question like, so do you do you have an audience on Linkedin? Oh, so you're saying. Should I branch onto Tiktok before I even have a proper audience on Linkedin. Is that the question.

453
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:07.760
Josh Sanders: I do believe. So. Yeah.

454
01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:08.535
Joden Newman: Yeah.

455
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:17.129
Dupe: I'm sorry to confuse. So my question is, I'm currently going on, Linkedin, as many of us are, and when is the best time?

456
01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:35.199
Dupe: Is there a good time to sort of split your time between the likes of Linkedin and Tiktok? Or to sort of go all in on Tiktok? Is it good to bring an audience with you from another platform? Or would you advocate for continuing to go on Linkedin, and making that as big as you can before moving on to Tiktok.

457
01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:38.340
Joden Newman: What what are you trying to achieve with growing on social.

458
01:29:40.170 --> 01:29:47.930
Dupe: I guess, and few things, but obviously leads my business, but just generally growing a personal brand and monetizing it.

459
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:48.580
Joden Newman: Where's that?

460
01:29:48.580 --> 01:29:48.990
Dupe: Yeah. Wrong.

461
01:29:49.537 --> 01:29:51.180
Joden Newman: And and words.

462
01:29:51.230 --> 01:29:56.619
Joden Newman: Would you? Do you think you'd be able to generate leads through tick, tock to your.

463
01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:01.769
Dupe: I think Tiktok would be more on my own personal brand side, and and monetizing that.

464
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:05.320
Joden Newman: Okay, so more more things like sponsorships.

465
01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:06.480
Dupe: Yes, exactly.

466
01:30:06.480 --> 01:30:11.548
Joden Newman: Okay. So yeah, I say, I have this in discovery calls quite often like,

467
01:30:12.498 --> 01:30:22.129
Joden Newman: I, I say, yeah, I wouldn't put money into it until you've got a good foothold on how it's gonna return on investment.

468
01:30:22.641 --> 01:30:30.579
Joden Newman: Unless you're super super rich in terms of like splitting yourself between Linkedin and Tiktok. I think

469
01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:39.219
Joden Newman: it's well, it's it's the the thing is you're saying, tick! Tock is a singular, but then, if you imagine, okay, is that splitting your time between Linkedin

470
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:49.390
Joden Newman: posts. And then some videos that can go on Linkedin, Instagram and Youtube, say, or just Linkedin, Instagram and Tiktok.

471
01:30:49.813 --> 01:31:16.009
Joden Newman: Then you're potentially growing a tiktok. You're still you've got a full Linkedin strategy, plus you're learning video, which is, gonna be more and more important, plus you've got an Instagram presence as well like in that sense. I say it is worth splitting that time. But in the sense of just singling out Tiktok, which is hard to convert from, I'd say. Probably not, although one of our clients, Charlotte.

472
01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:28.680
Joden Newman: he runs the fitting room agency, and she we well, she started on 500 followers, and we've been working together 2 weeks, and now she's we've only done like 3,000 followers.

473
01:31:29.195 --> 01:31:52.989
Joden Newman: Maybe like a couple of 100,000 views, and she's had, like loads of Linkedin fall off from it, and loads of like people wanting to book coaching calls. So also, everything I say is with the caveat is, if you make the right type of content and you hit it right on Tiktok, it could just immediately actually be part of your Linkedin strategy kind of like it has been for Charlotte.

474
01:31:53.390 --> 01:32:07.809
Dupe: Okay, that's cool. Interesting. Can I just ask a follow up question? Very cheekly, since I'm here, what? How do I? How do we work with you like? What's what is the format for working with your agency? What what do you offer? I'm assuming everything that you've talked about here, but it'd be good to hear.

475
01:32:08.150 --> 01:32:10.541
Joden Newman: Yeah, so well, yeah,

476
01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:17.903
Joden Newman: I don't have my pitching trousers on but we're yeah. We're fully done for you.

477
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:38.979
Joden Newman: premium like Content agency. So we like current clients Jordan Schwarzenberger, Charlotte Mayor, who I mentioned. And now we're working with James Watt, the founder of Brewdog like, where about like big names that we, you know, people with real missions like

478
01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:59.719
Joden Newman: that we want to, you know, get out there and just be as creative as possible, like a big thing of what we do is like having the content and making sure we can run a creative team like we're not like a sweatshop kind of agency. It's not just about content, content like it's about what people not saying. You know.

479
01:32:59.720 --> 01:33:10.986
Joden Newman: we we're kind of a bit beyond the hacky stuff. Just just to explain positioning. So we have one fully done for you offering, you know, for anything else.

480
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:18.029
Joden Newman: because, you know it's good to just have one thing, and we have that 6.5,000 pound a month.

481
01:33:18.090 --> 01:33:20.160
Joden Newman: and that's 10 videos a week.

482
01:33:20.310 --> 01:33:27.659
Joden Newman: And that well, yeah, as I said, like 3.5,000 views in our 1st week with Charlotte like it does work

483
01:33:28.118 --> 01:33:34.391
Joden Newman: but it is for those who can see a return on investment, and also,

484
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:52.530
Joden Newman: are, you know, got that creative sort of like, you know, vision for a brand like where where the people that do that. Basically. Yeah, fully done for you do all the posting, all that stuff. And yeah, producers. Great editors.

485
01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:56.999
Joden Newman: brilliant writers. Yeah, that's that's that's

486
01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:59.220
Joden Newman: that's us to be specific.

487
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:04.299
Dupe: And how many times, how many, for how many months do people usually work with you? You mentioned 6 and a half KA month

488
01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:06.200
Dupe: for me?

489
01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:25.314
Joden Newman: We we do term length. So we usually will have a contract that will be 6, 6, or 9 months we ideally go for 9. Obviously but we have a break clause at 3, because that usually protects us. And the person and the idea is that you know, growth is nonlinear and

490
01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:37.060
Joden Newman: Say, you know you work with, and this is for any agency that does a similar thing. You work within a month like you probably won't get the results you want. It's like all those graphs I showed. There's a logarithmic curve

491
01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:51.800
Joden Newman: sort of around the the 3rd or 4th month in general. So it's like we do try and lock in for as long well, as long as the time we can get but at least 6 months, so that we know that

492
01:34:51.870 --> 01:35:00.051
Joden Newman: you know it's been given time. But so far, you know, all of our we've had results immediately. That

493
01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:14.160
Joden Newman: you know, completely unlike whatever the channels we're working on have had before. So it's like, it's it's it's fairly assured. But yeah, they are. They are big term lengths. And it can be.

494
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:17.219
Joden Newman: you know, it's it's about being able to justify the cost.

495
01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:26.319
Josh Sanders: So awesome. So another question from Annie here, which type of support do you need if you start from scratch

496
01:35:27.170 --> 01:35:31.439
Josh Sanders: so like what would be your 1st hire if you were to not go with an agency approach.

497
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:38.679
Joden Newman: I would say, well, like with anything. It's the what's the bottleneck me. I'm

498
01:35:38.850 --> 01:35:48.710
Joden Newman: I'm a procrastinator when it comes to script writing so for me it would be a scriptwriter. But for you you might hate hate

499
01:35:48.770 --> 01:35:54.994
Joden Newman: slash art, procrastinate kind of the same thing video editing. So it would be a video editor.

500
01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.580
Joden Newman: if you're thinking on like something that would make your videos better.

501
01:35:59.982 --> 01:36:09.029
Joden Newman: Then like, say, it's not going well. But you want to put more money into it like a script. Writer with experience is probably gonna be the person

502
01:36:09.130 --> 01:36:20.020
Joden Newman: first, st because all the other stuff it does help. But the core of a video is gonna be the research and the idea. So I would say, that's gonna be

503
01:36:20.130 --> 01:36:31.850
Joden Newman: the yeah, the most important. Or once again, you're just a busy person, maybe a manager of sort, someone to know what needs to go out when or

504
01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:33.920
Joden Newman: a videographer.

505
01:36:34.818 --> 01:36:39.042
Joden Newman: I actually for me, I've changed my mind.

506
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:44.210
Joden Newman: no, yeah. Script writer. Then, videographer.

507
01:36:44.410 --> 01:36:55.289
Joden Newman: right? A videographer that comes to you and says, Get out of bed. It's time for video. Here's your scripts. That's an ideal for me. So yeah, I hope that answers your question.

508
01:36:55.710 --> 01:37:14.000
Josh Sanders: Amazing. And just to wrap up. I think one more question from Cassie. So she said, is there any main kind of differences between platforms and like similar to Linkedin. Is it worth engaging with other accounts before? Is engagement? Really, you know a big thing with these video platforms, or is it? Kind of just a little bit pointless?

509
01:37:14.806 --> 01:37:24.589
Joden Newman: It depends on to the level of engagement. So like on Linkedin, you wanna post and then try and comment on a bunch of things, and they comment, you know.

510
01:37:25.021 --> 01:37:41.669
Joden Newman: on Instagram it or or tick tock. There's no feed that goes. This person commented on this so that doesn't boost engagement, anyway. And if people, if you're like everyone liked my video, the fact that they've followed through it, they've found it through a link.

511
01:37:41.670 --> 01:37:49.019
Joden Newman: an external link instead of found it on the, for you feed. The algorithm knows that so doesn't see it as like genuine engagement. So

512
01:37:49.020 --> 01:38:13.629
Joden Newman: I would say, it's nice to respond to your comments like for the 1st half hour. It's just a good thing to do. Shows you're active, makes people feel like they can talk to you if they engage but in the same way of Linkedin. Absolutely not. But you will still get people have engagement groups on like Instagram, where, like especially starting out. It might be good to get like 10 people together. Whenever you post.

513
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:22.600
Joden Newman: you will go engage just to get that bump, because the early days on an Instagram account are a real slog.

514
01:38:22.670 --> 01:38:25.496
Joden Newman: so it can be good just to

515
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:31.609
Joden Newman: to do. But yeah, very different from Linkedin in how necessary it is, and how much of an impact it makes.

516
01:38:32.230 --> 01:38:42.358
Josh Sanders: Amazing Jordan. Thank you so much for this. My word, that was an incredibly comprehensive mass class. I think you covered pretty much everything with video. There.

517
01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:44.420
Joden Newman: Exactly. Exactly. There's nothing.

518
01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:44.760
Josh Sanders: Very.

519
01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.890
Joden Newman: I mean to sell really.

520
01:38:48.216 --> 01:38:49.560
Josh Sanders: I think. Yeah.

521
01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:55.520
Josh Sanders: quite a few people are pretty interested. So to reach you is, is it best email? Linkedin.

522
01:38:55.770 --> 01:39:13.169
Joden Newman: Yeah. joden@clashcreation.com. Yeah, it's on the website. Once again, clashcreation.com forward. Slash. Masterclass worked very hard on that free gift. So claim it. Now while it's there. Yeah, Linkedin email, I check the most, though definitely.

523
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:17.420
Josh Sanders: Amazing cool. I'll also include those links on the recording as well for those

524
01:39:17.830 --> 01:39:21.800
Josh Sanders: couldn't catch this one. But yeah, amazing man, thanks so much.

525
01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:22.770
Joden Newman: Appreciate it, man.

526
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:29.690
Josh Sanders: All good, all good hope. Everyone enjoyed that absolute masterclass. And yeah, I'll see you all soon.

527
01:39:29.690 --> 01:39:44.161
Joden Newman: Yeah, no, thank you. Thank you. Everyone for attending. That's the most anyone's listened to me ever. So I both congratulate you and apologize, but yes, thank you. Thank you all.



Intro:

So my aim in the next ten minutes is to show you exactly how to build a team that creates 40 pieces of content per month for only 1 day of your time.

This delegation method we use at Clash Creation to manage multiple clients & maintain high quality video that has created over 750 million views this year.

By creating a content team, you are deciding to hand the keys over for somebody else to sit in the driver's seat of your personal brand.

So it can feel scary.

So why do it?

To effectively create viral video day in, day out, you need to fulfill these roles:
Strategist
Writer
Editor
Producer
Manager

5 full time jobs. 

Literally impossible for one person to do without cutting serious corners.

And you could do that.

Film on your iphone
Write scripts on the tube
Hope that something goes viral

But what happens when your kid is sick, or something falls through at work? Or life happens?

Are you still going to get that post up about career hacks?

No.

You’re going to let the posting schedule slip. Letting your followers down & your views plummet.

That’s why the best in the industry - Ali Abdaal, Chris Donnelly & Steven Bartlett all have dedicated teams to turn their content creation into a well oiled machine.

This is who you’re up against.

But that’s not it.

Treating your personal brand like a business, means that it should pay for itself. 

With delegation, you’ll turn your mad rush to create content, into a well oiled machine.

Here’s how you do it.


Step 1: Establish your vibe

Before you take anyone on, the first step is to experiment. Create a burner account, Upload some Tiktoks, get used to the writing, filming, editing and posting process. 

From this initial 2-4 weeks of experimentation, you should be able to find out what type of thing you’d like to talk about, establish your pillars, buckets and framing. 

At this point, you’re ready to start building a team.

Step 2: Find your team
One at a time.

First you’ll need a scriptwriter.

Here’s what you need to look for:

Someone who enjoys writing, understands social media, and will push you to lean more towards what does well.
This person will need a strong track record of social posts and be able to answer these questions:

Why did your posts do well? Great answers will include a mix of:
I spoke about X subject
I used hooks like X
The visuals looked like X
A lot of people commented because of X

	Bad answers will look like:
Well I posted a lot
It just randomly took off
Something weird happened in the video

A writer is so much more than a copy writer or a journalist. Your writer is the reason why people will stay on your video or go. 

Once your writer is doing well, next you need to find an editor.

To keep costs down, you can find incredible editors in other countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.

Sites like online jobs will be your first port of call. You get a lot of spam applicants so here’s what to avoid:

“Multi discipline” people - you’re a video editor, a personal assistant and an entrepreneur? Hmm I’m not sure

Sweat shops - most people are fine, but some may outsource work to way cheaper clients. They have brilliant portfolios, but once you hire them, the quality of work goes down, edits take longer & there’s general bad communication.

These guys are hard to spot. The best way to do it is to ask tough, detailed questions that only an editor would know in the interview.

Notes:

To come up with your pillars you need to think about what you’re selling: yourself, or a product. 

[example deciding pillars for yourself + brand]

Selling a product, and selling yourself, are pretty similar. If you’re building your character with your audience, really you’re just working on selling your future sponsorship endorsements.

And either way, it’s good to have yourself throughout as much of your content as possible, especially in the game of wanting to be an authority figure in your niche, whatever that may be. 

Buckets in Practice:

[examples]

[Use visual of a venn diagram to show the overlap (when we do clients our bigger package is for around 10 videos a week – 3 IG exclusives, 3 TT exclusives, if one goes huge on one platform then repost]


Ideas:
Maybe show ‘content that doesn’t work’ at the start of the video. (or content that isn’t assured)

Definitely go over providing value outside of the purely educational. Or reframing it to produce better results.

Content on Framing

Same content on hooks

Making yourself a familiar face. Your face needs to be next to the thing you’re an authority of as much as possible, in lots of different ways.

Don’t on logos, intros, strong brand messaging, etc – short form video is all about the subconscious messaging – it’s all about the emotional, not the logical.

Importance of the first few seconds

Lots of examples (PDF for each module of the course)

Be as visual as possible.

Basics Structure:
Introduction:
[needs hype]
Hi, I’m Joden, and welcome to my masterclass on the ‘basics of social media’. In this short course we’ll focus on how to make videos that get outsized returns, and position you as a voice of authority. 

With social media, the goal is two-fold, 1. You want to get lots and lots of views and 2. You want to become ‘the guy who…’ not ‘one of those’ guys who. 

This course will take you through my formula for social media that I discovered building accounts for Chris Donnelly, Ben Askins and myself. And if it’s followed correctly, it’s guaranteed to get you results. 

[display results from your clients on screen]

First we’ll go through picking your content pillars, and I’ll explain how these inform your high-level social media strategy. Then we’ll get into the actual strategy. First I’ll discuss buckets, and formats. Then I’ll go on to explain the basics of scripting, editing and filming and what actually makes a good hook. 

Then finally we’ll get into some of the analytics, like posting, metrics, and engagement. Plus some tips on what to do, after you’ve gone viral. 

And if at the end you’re still wanting more, the specifics of how this fits into a conversion funnel will be covered in the advanced course: Why is short form video a different beast to Linked In

At the end of each section I’ve set a little ‘bonus task’. This isn’t essential to following the video, but if you choose to do it. You can come away from this course with a decent content strategy. So I’d recommend it if you want the full value from this. 

I’d also recommend going back and doing these tasks once you’ve finished watching the course, to see how much of it you’ve remembered. 

What is short form content and what are the benefits?

Benefits? An organic audience, which if you convert with the right funnel, will follow you anywhere. 

Who is Short Form not for
It’s not for people without a funnel in place,
Not for people without anyway to capture leads
It’s not likely to be for people with a customer demographic that doesn’t align with the platform
It’s not for people with a very specific customer when very early on in their business
It’s not for people who don’t have a clear journey to profit off of the views. ‘Awareness’ is good, but it’s a long way from conversion
It’s not for businesses in which it’s their ONLY form of marketing (?)
It’s not for people who play things safe,
It’s not for people who are boring. No amount of tricks fixes a boring person. It’s a shallow platform, and that doesn’t necessarily mean looks, but it does mean vibes – people are there to be entertained in some way or another.

Who is short form for?

People whose business will benefit from organic growth/

Pillars:

What are short form pillars, and why are they important?

Pillars are the first step to a good social media strategy. 

Pillars are the guiding principles, beliefs and personality of your brand. How do you work out your short form pillars if you haven’t got them? (with example)
How do you work out your short form pillars if you have already got them, but not yet for short form?

You may already have brand pillars, which is great. But they probably need tweaking towards short form content. Again you’ve got to focus on who you are, how you want to come across, and what other people will actually care about. 

Worked example

Let’s go through my pillars for the main man himself, Chris Donnelly. 

Pillars are gonna be the intersection of the function of the channel (what you’re trying to do), your personal beliefs and who you’re trying to reach. 

These are 3, 4, maybe 5 things

So when we started Chris had had a lot of personal success in business, and also built up a big following on LinkedIn. He wanted to transfer this success to tiktok, and get his personal branding out there. So the buckets we came up with were:

Advocating a healthy workplace culture
Managing yourself/productivity
Good, exciting businesses and 
Personal success stories. 

Simple. We chose these pillars as they cover the full range of what he does, in a way that’s interesting to people on tiktok, and broad enough to be split up into multiple pieces of content. 

Buckets:

What are your content buckets, and why are they important?

Ok next is content buckets. 

Buckets make up the core of your content, they’re your signature ‘types’ of videos that people will associate with your content.

In  general you’ve had 3 or 4 of these that are completely unique to your channel. 

Don’t worry, they’re very simple to make. 

How do you work out your content buckets?


Buckets are actually very simple to work out. 

Buckets are just a combination of your pillars, which we went through in the last section [point at screen] and formats. 

ON SCREEN: Advocating a healthy workplace culture, Managing yourself/productivity, Good, exciting businesses and Personal success stories. 

What is a format?

Formats are the basic structures of every short form video. 

They’re simple, pre-validated, and in most cases, you can just steal them from other creators.

Some examples of formats include:

React videos - these are videos where there’s another video playing on the screen, and you’re watching it and giving your reaction [example]

Green screen videos - this format is someone talking with a green screen of an article/ study/ some piece of information behind you, and you’re talking about it

Podcast Style - now I know you all love this one. These are clips of videos from podcasts.

Talking head - this is the most simple of all the formats. It’s just you, talking to a camera, about a particular topic

Making buckets from your pillars

So you’ve got your formats, but they’re empty, so now you’ve got to fill them with something, to give them substance. And this substance comes from your pillars. 

So to make a bucket all we need to do is combine the two. 

With every client, the first thing I do is sit down with each pillar, and think of which formats I could combine it with, to come up with as many buckets as possible. 

Let’s do that together. 
Worked example

Ok so let’s work through making buckets for the "Managing Yourself/Productivity" pillar:

First up, the react format. This is one of the most viral formats about, so always worth having in your strategy. 

So combining that reacts, with productivity: 

You’ve got a bucket where you’re reacting to viral productivity hacks or "hustle culture" advice and showing that it’s bullshit, and offering an actual alternative. 

Perfect so that’s one bucket. Now what about the green screen format? 

Well, combining that with productivity. We can have you chatting about a recent study or fact about productivity, with a green screen of it behind you. 

See it’s actually quite simple. 

Next let’s take the vlog style format. Maybe a ‘day in the life’. This would work great with productivity as you can show your morning routine, work routine and social life with some productivity tips scattered in. 
My tip here would be to film yourself on a super interesting day (with events etc) so your life looks really interesting. 

ANd then a final format you could use here would be the ‘on screen comparison format’/ THis is typically a talking head with a wall of text on screen, comparing the two. 

And perfect for this bucket would be a ‘Don’t do this’ list on the left and a ‘do this instead’ list on the right, with productivity myths on the left that you disagree with, and your suggested alternatives. 

So that's 4 content buckets, for just one pillar. 

Extend this out to all of your pillars and you could have up to 20. 

Task: As an exercise go through and work out 4 example buckets for each pillar. 

But that’s way too many. 

The ideal number of buckets

So, you’ve got your buckets, I’m guessing you’ve written down between 15 and 20.

But realistically that is too many. You can’t get people interested in 20 buckets. Your profile will be confused. 

The ideal is 4-5 regular buckets that you’re known for.  You need to be known for about 4-5. 

So how do you choose the right ones? 

Trial and error. 

Go through the master list you’ve made, pick your favourites and start testing them out. If it turns out they’re taking too much time to research, or they’re performing badly? Scrap them and try another one. 
This process can take a while, but that’s part of how initial growth works: social media is a science, and it takes some experimentation 

Ideally after a few months you’ll have some clue of which buckets are for you, and the dream is you'll land at around 5 tried and tested buckets that are varied, interesting, and appeal to the full spectrum of your target audience (don’t worry, we’ll get to attracting that in the next section).

Not all formats are made equal

Ok so as I’m sure you noticed in the exercise. Some formats lend themselves better to one topic than another. Not all formats are made equal. 

Like how the on screen comparison format we used in the previous example worked great for productivity, but would be really hard to fit in with the personal success stories pillar. 

Different things need communicating in different ways. 

Best practice here is to have a good range of different formats. 

Formats on different platforms

Now note that the formats also change, from platform to platform. The tiktok algorithm favours longer, talking style videos, preferably over 1 minute (especially if you want that creator fund money) whereas Instagram tends to favour super quick, 15 second text style posts.

Bonus: If you want to become ‘the guy who’

Ok so this won’t be necessary for all of you, and definitely isn’t strategy 101. But the goal with buckets is to become ‘the guy who’. 

And the way to get this? Is by inventing a unique format. 

For example, everyone knows Jordan the Stallion, you might not know his name but if you watch short form you’ll definitely know his content’ 

He’s the ‘guy who’ holds up his phone to the mirror and talks to it. 

You know, this guy (get Jordan’s profile up on the screen)

He’s ‘the guy who’. 
This is because he’s consistent with a unique format, that no one else does, he invented it. The beauty of it means he can talk about anything he really wants with it still being on brand for him. 

But this is something we work towards. Don’t try this on week 1. 

Start off with pre-validated formats until you’ve built up some level of following - and then start to get creative once you can afford to.

High level strategy. 

How does the algorithm work?

The question now is how you get millions of random people on the internet to care about what you’re posting. 

The best thing, and the worst thing about short form is it’s a pure democracy. You’re competing with millions of other videos for people's attention, and this can be pretty humbling. 

Every time you post, it gets sent to a random batch of a few hundred people. If they like it — great, the video will get pushed to more people. But if that original batch doesn't like it, the video will flop, and you’ll get stuck at a few hundred views. 

In the early days of posting, as I'm sure you know, this can be really disheartening. You know there is an audience out there who will care about your content, but they just aren’t seeing your videos. 

The basics of a fast growth strategy: The ratio


The trick here is finding a strategy that will get your videos over the initial bump so that you can find your ideal audience. 

In general, I’ve found that following this ratio works very well. 

[30 broad: 40 focussed: 20 niche: 10 sale]
[Awareness (30%) – alignment (40%) (your face and your niche) – authority(20%) – cash (10%)]

So you want 30% of your videos to be broad - to bring awareness, 40% focussed - to bring alignment, 20% niche - to establish authority and 10% sales - for cash.

(oh look, what do you know, it looks like a funnel doesn’t it)

[image of a funnel]

Broad - Awareness


So the broad content is for the general audience who don’t care who you are, don’t care what your pillars are, they just want to watch something fun and engaging. These are the viewers that can get you over that initial hump, and will be responsible for most of the millions of views on your profile and your first batch of followers. 

Bear in mind this isn’t your ideal audience, as from experience you probably can't sell to them - but you still need them, to get access to the right people. 

Advocating a healthy workplace culture
Managing yourself/productivity
Good, exciting businesses and 
Personal success stories. 

A good example of a bucket for broad awareness with Chris's pillars, came from the ‘healthy workplace culture’ pillar. Our thinking was that, everyone’s had a job that sucks, or knows someone whose job sucks. SO it’s easy to make interesting for everyone. 

What we decided to do was combine this with the ‘reaction’ format. Specifically reacting to texts. 

And what we came up with was Chris reacting to text interactions between toxic bosses and employees. 

I’m sure you’ve seen some of these, they ended up going really viral. What’s great here, is obviously it brings in views, but there’s a chance to add some authority and advice, without it being all about Chris. 

And most importantly, you’re jumping off of a controversial interactions for views, and engagement. 

This was also a new format, reacting to text messages, and established Chris as ‘the guy who (reacts to crazy boss stories).

This was great for two reasons. First, once you’re the guy who, people remember you name. But most importantly they’re more likely to watch your other stuff and look for you on other platforms. 


Win-win. 

https://www.tiktok.com/@twinscott/video/7373707032546774304?q=cool%20marketing%20campaigns&t=1727259355770 

So that’s 30% of your content. The next 40% should be focussed for alignment. This is still fun engaging content that will align more closely with your brand pillars.
Focussed - Alignment

Ok so this 40% should be going to a more focussed audience, to bring in alignment. 

This acts similarly to the broad content, in terms of bringing in big numbers, but these videos should attract the viewers that are pretty interested in who you are, and more likely to be converted to actual fans. That’s why this is the one we want to push most, when it comes to personal branding. 

A good example of this bucket with Chris’s content came from this ‘good, exciting businesses’ pillar. There are millions of great businesses so you’re not in a deficit for inspiration. Plus it gives you a position to give yourself more authority, than in the broad 30%. 

Again here, what we settled on was the reactions format. 

On Screen: *some formats are much more viral than others, and reacts are big hitters, so good for these wider reaching parts of strategy. 

A good example of this we did was be reacting to great/terrible dragons den pitches. This gave Chris an opportunity to discuss some of the business decision making, whilst also jumping off the fact people can enjoy watching a tv clip. 

There's space here to give genuine advice, and come across as a stronger personality and authority, than with the text stories. 

So you’ve got 30 broad, 40 focussed. 20% of your content should then be niche.

Niche - Authority

Ok so we’ve got 70% of the content. The majority of the views. Now it’s time to really speak to our core audience. 

This 20% is for fans who decided to follow from the broad/focussed content, and now want to learn a bit more about who you are, and what you have to say.

This content should be much more personal, and high in value. And while these videos might not bring in as high numbers as that other 70% it’s ok — you don’t need it. They’ll probably have pretty high engagement (i.e., they’re fans so more likely to like, comment and watch the whole way through) and most importantly, a higher possibility of conversion into your funnel. 

A good bucket example here we took from the Personal Career Stories pillar. A great example would be pushing an inspirational message that’s applicable to most people, through the lens of a story from your career. 

In this case, the format is simple - just talking head, so you can deliver it cleanly without any other distractions. 

A great example of this is: https://www.tiktok.com/@donnellycss/video/7299898388152192288?q=no%20overnight%20successes%20chris%20donnelly&t=1727622069712 

It’s still engaging and accessible - but really pushes him as a voice of authority, and helps build his fanbase. 

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-wHm0WPto_/?igsh=NmhoNnFrcm1qMHFj 

So we’ve now got 90% of our content strategy sorted. 

Sale - (Cold Hard) Cash

The final 10% of your content is focussed fully on sales, whether that’s selling yourself or selling your product - but they’re really not that different. 

https://www.tiktok.com/@donnellycss/video/7257184492777999643 

https://www.tiktok.com/@donnellycss/video/7225678836397034778 

This will likely bring in even fewer numbers than the niche content, but the hope is that the other 90% has built an audience big enough and engaged enough, that this will go to the people that care. 

So that’s it we’ve got 100% of the content sorted. 

Task

Ok so with the 30:40:20:10 rule in mind. Can you go through the list you made in the last task and think about where you’d place each of those buckets? 

More learnings from the the ratios

I hope the task went alright. 

But I have to admit something. 

You know the pure democracy thing I said earlier? That’s actually kind of a lie.

Whilst its definitely true for new accounts, but once your account has grown big enough — it looks a whole lot more like a monopoly. 

Yep, once you’ve built up a decent audience, the video doesn't just go to a random few hundred people it goes to people who like your content already - with a couple randoms chucked in.

This means your video is much more likely to succeed, and much more likely to go to the right people next. 

Right, so it’s like a snowball, the bigger and more engaged your audience is, the bigger and more engaged your audience is gonna get. 

And if you follow this 40:30:20:10 rule - you’re almost guaranteed quick growth. 

Now of course. Once you’ve built up a decent audience, these don’t have to be stuck to religiously. You can meddle with these ratios all you want depending on your specific goals. 

For example if you’re just going for ad revenue and you’re just looking to be an entertainer or influencer, then pump the broad content, if you’re doing a big marketing push for a new offering, then pump the niche stuff and the sales.

But overall 40:30:20:10, stick to your pillars, and get to your core audience as quick as possible (whilst also having huge numbers)

The Funnel

So we’ll probably touch more on this in a more advanced course, that dives a little deeper into how 

Your main goal is to take people from being aware of you, to knowing and liking you, and then getting people off platform as quickly as possible. You want to get people

Hooks

The hook: a brief history

Now hooks. This is the most important, and the most misunderstood part of social media.  

First thing is that hooks aren’t new. 

Billboards 
Book titles 
Newspapers 
Research papers
Film posters 

Creators of media have always had to fight for people's attention. You read the article with the best headline, pick the book with the best cover — because, we do judge books by their covers, and people will judge your video by the hook. 

Why is a good hook so important?

The hook sets the entire tone of understanding, needs to get people interested in watching, and is most people’s only experience with the video. 

That’s why the hook is genuinely more important than what you say in the rest of the script, and it all happens in the first 3-5 seconds of your video. 

What makes a good hook?

There’s 4 elements to a good hook: intrigue, clarity, authority, and delivery.

Intrigue
First up, intrigue

Intrigue isn’t about being ‘mysterious’ — it’s about setting up as many questions in the viewers mind as possible. 
Like what perks you up more:

“Hey, did I tell you about the craziest thing that ever happened to me?”
“Hey, did you hear about the time I was locked up in a swiss prison for treason?”

Obviously the second, because the hook has promised specifically how crazy the story could be. It’s got some details up front that spark a lot more questions, like why were they in Switzerland, how long were they in prison for, who commits treason> 


Whereas the first sounds relative, it’s hyperbolic, and sounds like bullshit.

Knowing more details is oftentimes more intriguing than knowing less, up to a point of course. Outside of convincing your friends to listen to your story, news headlines are also very good at striking the perfect balance between enough detail to capture your attention, and little enough to incline you to read on further.

To be intriguing you need to give the core of the video away as soon as possible. 

Man in dallas texas just got decapitated trying to groom his dog

Now all the details, still like - how?

You won’t believe what happened to this man who was grooming his dog. 

Being intriguing isn’t mysterious, it’s making big bold statements and then filling in the gaps. 

Also - don’t be too clickbait ‘number 4 will shock you’ everyone knows what your doing, that won’t shock anyone at all. 

A good way to think about this is how many questions are you opening up, in the hook. Backed up by the Zeigarnik effect. People want all the answers as soon as possible. 

Either do it explicitly ‘how did this man earn 1 million dollars with a toothbrush’ 

Or more subtle ‘I just did the most embarrassing thing’ - what did they do, what’s the most embarrassing thing, have I ever done that before? 
Clarity
The next element is Clarity

This is arguably even more important than intrigue. 

When people are scrolling on social media, they're in a passive state. 

Your hook should be understood by a drunk man falling asleep and a child with ADHD alike. 

If there’s anything complex about your hook, they’re gone. It needs to speak to the monkey brain, and that monkey brain needs to immediately understand what the videos are about and if they’re even interested. 

And ideally you want to do this in as few words, and as simple words as possible. 
Authority
The third important element of a hook is authority

What you’re doing in a hook is you’re trying to invite an audience in, and close the gap between them and you. 

It’s people’s introduction to you. 

A big mistake a lot of people make, especially founder/entrepreneur types coming from a familiarity with Linked In is ASSUME that the audience knows a lot of things about them.

They assume the audience knows anything about them and say things like ‘if I could start all over again, these would be the changes I’d make.

They assume the audience cares about what they’re saying, and say things like ‘here’s the best marketing strategy…’

But worst of all, they assume that what they have to say is SO valuable, that people will just naturally be drawn to it.

Now I shouldn’t be the first to tell you that when you assume, you make an ass out of u and me. In fact the only thing we can assume is that the audience is a blank slate, a Tabula Rasa with a slight disposition toward certain topics – but they don’t know who you are, they don’t know why what you’re saying is interesting, and they definitely don’t know why they should care [write on board]
 
[examples]
Delivery
And finally the last thing is delivery. 

The best hook ever, if delivered badly, just sounds terrible. 

What you need to bring to this is energy. And not shouting energy, that doesn’t work, but just natural energy. As a general rule it's good to talk to the camera like you’re talking to your friends. Keep it natural. 

For the hook, you need to deliver it like you’re with your friends and you’ve just remembered a crazy story and you get all excited about it. Translate that energy to camera, and people might stay for the rest of your video. 
Extra Tips
And finally a couple tips on writing hooks. 

First, should you use hook lists? Well there are some good turns of phrase that work, like ‘this just happened’ brings to the immediate, or ‘these are 5 things that’. But ultimately, using a list without thinking about authority, delivery, intrigue and clarity, will just fall flat. 

Finally, its always good to boost a hook, with an additional text hook. Ideally this is just a few words that give a little more intrigue/ context to what you’re saying. In general people will read this before they hear what you say. So make sure this isn’t distracting from your otherwise perfect hook, and that people still know what your video is about.

Scripting

My philosophy of scripting


Cool so we’ve got people hooked, now we need people to stay until the end of the video, the way we do that is with a good script. 

The problem is, with social media, viewers are a constant flight risk. They know at any second of your video, they could leave and do literally anything else. 

This means to write a really good script, you need to get inside the mind of a viewer where every single second is a struggle, and make it easy for them to stay to the end. 

Luckily, I have a really good mental model for this.

For the general viewer, watching a tiktok is like pushing a boulder. 
You want them to get it from point A to point B, without giving up and losing their attention; and they are happy to do that, as long as it’s easy for them to push it.

And the key to a good script is making that as easy as possible. 

Now your script is the terrain they’re pushing the boulder on, and the goal is to facilitate the most frictionless journey for your viewer.

But the thing about viewers, like boulders, is that they’re lazy. If you’re not pushing them, they’re just gonna fall back down the hill. Which in video terms, means they’ll get bored and just stop watching. 

This sets up what I like to call a momentum approach to scripting. 

To get someone to watch your whole video, you need to keep the momentum going. 

The hook, which we’ve already covered, is the initial incline. It will push them upwards over the initial hump, and then even if what you say after is a bit boring, they should still have some momentum to keep them going. 

The rest of the script will then look a little like this. 

These downward slopes are periods of great writing. There’s curiosity, sensationalism and intrigue. It’s easy to understand, and will keep your viewers watching. 

These flat straights, are when you’re giving plain information and delivery. This is normally necessary to a script, so you have to make sure they’ve got enough momentum before, or that you give them and extra push.

An extra push is basically a rehook. Much like a hook at the beginning of the video, this is a sentence that regrabs their attention, and makes them want to keep watching. 

These uphill periods are what’s difficult. This is usually like delivering something difficult to understand, or difficult to hear, like brand messaging or a sale. People really don’t want  to get through this, so you need a huge run up and a huge amount of momentum to hopefully push them over this. 

The key is never letting the script get to a standstill. As this is where you lose everyone. 

So a couple overall tips. 

Sandwich boring information with something sensational. 

Keep rehooking as much as you can. 

And remember that it’s tiktok, not linkedin. Fancy words and complex sentences are just too hard to follow. Make sure the language is simple, easy to understand, playful, and effective. 

If you can say a sentence in fewer words — do. 

Authority


For those of you with a product to sell, or a business to run, entertaining people isn’t enough. You need to be impressing people constantly, and to no end, so that they trust what you say no matter what you say.

Because, the harsh truth is, building a personal brand on an entertainment platform is hard. Promoting you, your businesses, and your services at many times is going to be boring, so it has to feel important. For many of you in the Creator Accelerator, education is going to be a strong part of your strategy – and if any of you remember school, learning is boring unless it feels important.

There’s also the element of ‘why should I listen to you’
This is about leveraging your accolades as social proof.

This is important for:
Engagement. People engage with videos more and watch for longer when they consider what’s being said important. Authority gives your videos gravitas to people who know more about who you are.
Community building. Your more casual viewers will form a deeper connection with your brand as they learn your accolades – so make sure they’re learning them.
Conversion – Following that, conversion is a lot easier the more that people trust you, 
And cross platform pollination – Signposting your authority makes you more than just another ‘tiktok guy’, and many fans will go look for you in other places, like Linked In, YouTube, or even your newsletter if you have one.

So how can we insert authority into our videos?
Over the course of this section, I’m going to go over several methods you can implement in your scripts that will bolster your authority.

White coat Syndrome
Results and Accolades
Demographic Alignment
Graphs and Numbers
Consistency
The Meta-visual
Association
Trust

Cheese and Pill Method
Using a popular framing/format to then use it to seamlessly segue into something within your niche, which sets up the relevance of your expertise/ niche/ brand. An example would be using a news story about a popular celebrity as a means to highlight an issue you happen to solve

‘The insecure teenager’
This is one I talk about a lot on strategy calls, it’s a way of inserting your credentials and accolades into every video that you make
Upfront
This was covered in the hook section, but it’s worth noting again because it’s really important, especially when you’re just starting out with a channel. 

“I sold my company to google, and these are 5 things no business owner will tell you”
“University is a SCAM 
Your Profile
Make sure when people click through to your profile that they know exactly why they should listen to you. Choose your bio carefully, you only get a small amount of characters to get across who you are and what you do.

Filming

Introduction to filming

Won’t cover too much here, just give a basic intro to they ways I film. 

Batched filming vs Non batched filming

So there are two main options with filming: batched and non batched. 

With my clients, we tend to do batched filming. They’re all pretty busy. So once a fortnight they sit down with me for a few hours, bring a few changes of clothes, and film 14-20 scripts. 


This is intensive, but it saves time. If you end up delegating to a team, it means you’ve only got to sit down and focus on your short form for a few hours twice a month. 

But, bath filming doesn’t work with everyone’s schedule. Some people like to film off the cuff, as and when inspiration hits. 

If you’re interested in the batch filming method, then here’s a few tips on how to make that work. 
Performance Tips

When i shoot with clients this is how i do it. 

I like to think about filming a tiktok, like talking to a friend. 

It needs to feel natural, not like a performance. Kind of like you at 1.5%. You’re energised and on the ball, but still very genuine and yourself. 

The thing about genZ is the second they notice anything that feels disingenuous? They’re gone. 

When I’m filming with a client, to make that easier, I like to sit them down in front of the camera and bounce back and forth with them. Have a chat with them in a chair so they feel a little more natural. 

Now some of you, like many of my clients at the beginning, are a little camera shy. Or camera stiff. 

This is completely natural if you’re not used to it. These are some things I say to help them loosen up. 

First, repeat the lines a few times to make it feel natural before you perform. No need to manage the lines, as usually they’ll be on a teleprompter. 

But reading direct of the teleprompter can be boring (remember if you’re boring, so is your content).

If you’re feeling super self conscious. Then a great tip to get out of your head, is to shout the lines, whisper the lines, say them in a weird accent i don’t know, just whatever you need to do to rid yourself of self consciousness and enjoy the process.

Another tip for batch filming is to put the highest energy scripts up front at the start of the session. Filming 20 tiktoks, especially when you’re new to it, can be draining, so the scripts that need ‘more’ from you, put first. 

Also - don’t stress about these. Expect more redos for the first few things you do. My general rule is that the first take should be scrapped. 

If you want to do it as and when. Practise what you’re gonna say, imagine you’re on facetime. 

If you want to get comfortable in front of camera. Shout it, whisper it, say it in a funny accent - basically rid yourself of self confidence. 

And my final tip on performance? When you want someone to feel an emotion, portray that emotion. 

If it’s funny? Laugh. Outrage? Be outraged. Sad, look actually sad (bonus if you can cry). 

Framing (Bonus)

This lesson’s all about what’s actually put on the screen, 

Any cinematographer will tell you that the way you light, frame, and cut things will communicate a message to your viewer, and it’s their job to make sure that the message being sent visually aligns with the intended message of the video.

So quite simply, we’ve got our rectangle here which represents the phone screen, and bit by bit we’re going to look at what needs to go where.

First, absolutely the number 1 step, we need to account for the GUI interfaces of the different social media platforms. Unlike YouTube or other editorial platforms, The engagement buttons, the description, and even the search bar appear on the video itself, obstructing your lovely video. Yes viewers can technically turn it off, but let’s be real, they seldom will.

So let’s account for that. First we know there are engagement buttons along the right side of the screen, so we don’t want to put anything important there. Then the video’s caption usually goes somewhere around here, plus some platforms have a follow button here, some platforms have an ad down here, or here – so we can just discount that entire area. Then some phones have a notch right here so that’s in the way – and we can’t forget about the search bar here, oh and that weird TikTok shop button that’s sometimes going on up here – oh and don’t forget, most platforms have a slight horizontal crop – meaning the edges of your video aren’t here, they’re here.

So with all that crossed out, that leaves us with this area – the only parts of the screen we can guarantee will be visible. And this area generally has a name – the ‘safe zone’. By the way, for those of you editing your videos on a computer, I’ve included this safe zone as a png overlay in the downloads section of this module.

But ok great, this is progress, we know where we should and shouldn’t put things.

Next we gotta talk about the order of importance.

So, whatever the most important detail of your video is, should go in this general area – the visual centre.

This is where we need to tap into a bit of design theory – so in short – one principle goal of design is to draw a viewer’s eye to the most important detail first, the second most important second, the third… and so on.
The easiest way to do this is simply to put the most important detail where the eye is already looking, and people usually first look an image in it’s visual centre

The visual centre is different from the geometric centre, basically, in short, people perceive the centre of a page to be slightly above where it actually, mathematically is.

Hence why you want to put your key detail in this area.

Then, one more vitally important thing, is to keep everything simple. You don’t want subtitles that move all over the place, while also needing people to look at what’s happening in the video, while also reading some text on screen. It’s important to keep everything clean, only use graphics when they really help tell the story.

Video is a visual medium, which means visuals should support the message and give it the best possible chance to shine, not fight against it. 

Keep things simple, clean, and coherent.
Editing
Introduction to Editing

Editing is an incredibly important part of short form video. 

The edit can add, or detract from a video. And what we’re looking for is for the edit to add something. 

Most of you won’t be doing the editing, and will be taking on an editor. But as I’ve found, finding a good editor who understands what works on short form, is hard to come by. 

Inhouse we have a system, developed by me, that I train each of my editors on. 

Editing tips to give your team 

A lot of editing ends up taking away from a video. It can make it distracting, to the poitn it’s difficult to even concentrate on what the video is about, and what you’re saying. 

My overall advice? Don’t do too much. 

Here's my main tips to give your editing team:

Number one: Keep the screen as clear as possible
Too many graphics will confuse the viewer. The speakers face should always be in full view, and it should be incredibly simple what is happening in the video at all time.

Number two, keep cuts quick, but let them breathe when they should
Never let your audience get bored. If the video is dynamic, with quick cuts, the viewer will feel like there’s movement happening. 
But, too much cutting can give the viewer whiplash. If you’re explaining something important, let the viewer breathe. 

Number three: Lots of graphics will distract from the message. 
If you’re cluttering your video with too many graphics, either on screen, or cutting to new screens, your viewer might get lost. Graphics instantly grab attention, and sometimes, they can grab the viewer’s attention away from the video. 

Number four: Every edit needs to have a purpose. 
Whether you’re trying to further an emotion, or enhance the information. You’ve got to make edits that make sense. 
This will look different for every video, and every style, but don’t just edit for editing’s sake. 

Overall you want to make sure your edits are restrained and not over the top, but are still dynamic enough to stop people getting bored. 



Extra mod (delegation): 
Introduction to delegation

For those with video teams (on delegation, on working)
“Now I know a lot of people watching this are likely to be delegating a large amount of this work, and I just want to go over what this looks like in the context of a company.
What should you be most involved in? What should you avoid?

Ideation, strategy. This is the part you should be most involved in
Google docs workflow, with emojis to show stages, talk about benefits (frictionless). The reason for putting all in one doc is often several videos will be recorded at once, so your script documents acts as an itinerary for the shoot day.

Hiring an editor. 

You can hire an editor in house, but I tend to hire editors offshore. 

I tend to look at websites like: x

And the skills to look for are: Adobe suite. A lot of people list this as a skill,but when you press, can’t use it very well. 

Be wary of middle men. There’s a lot of ‘editors’ who are actually just passing off the work to their network of freelancers. This can make the edits inconsistent, and your feedback is rarely actually followed. 

Whether offshore or not, you need to make sure your editor can learn with your brand, and develop the exact craft for your style of videos. 
Tips when choosing an editor

Finding a good editor is hard. Here’s a few lessons I’ve learnt. 

First up, make sure the editor is comfortable with cutting out parts of the video that dont work.

What works on the script doesn’t always work on the video. In almost every video I’ve ever made, we won't use all of the script - there’s just a couple too many lines. 

If the pacing of the video is slowing down, make sure your editor is happy to cut it out. 

Second, make sure your editor gets you. 

A big part of editing is understanding the core of why a video is interesting, and editing it to align with that. 

A good example here is humour. If you’re trying to make funny content, you’ve got to pick an editor who understands what’s funny about the video, and is able to edit it to make it even funnier. 

Third, you need to pick an editor who’s adaptable. 

When first working with someone, it’s likely there will be a lot of changes needed to get it to your vision. The editor needs to be adaptable, who can do more than just one style, or your videos will seem flat. 

Hiring a scriptwriter 

Again to find a scriptwriter, you can find people on websites like fiverr or upwork. Or best practice is to find someone in house. 

For this, if you’re hiring offshore, it’s much more likely that you’ll need an editor. A lot of scripting requires a good grasp of English, and the nuances, if the script writer doesn’t have this you might end up sinking a lot of time in editing — even if they’re cheaper. 

A good script writer will have some experience with short form, whether professionally or just as an interest. Writing articles, writing TV scripts and writing short form scripts are completely different skillsets - and you need to make sure you find someone who ‘gets it’ 

In general my approach to hiring, is find someone with the potential to be trained up, with energy and an enthusiasm for the work, vs someone with the technical skills: technical skills can always be taught, attitude can’t. 

The scriptwriter also has to be a pretty adept researcher, so make sure someone has this skillset (you don’t want them doing research on ChatGPT and you end up spreading misinformation by accident).

Posting:

Introduction to posting
Your video is finished, it’s 100% grade-A gold. Now for the scary bit: actually sending this thing out into the world.

I’d like to assure you, 98% of the work is done. I feel the need to stress this because it is at this point, the point where you finally post the content, that snake oil social media guru types will tell you all the ‘hacks’ come into play. Posting times, hashtags, trending sounds, engaging with other accounts, all these things are for the most part, 1% differences.

In this section, I’m going to go over all the infinitesimal details around posting your content, so that you watch this once, and never have to worry about posting politics again.

The Short
For those of you on the go, and want the quick and easy answers for this whole section, this video is for you
What, when, and how often?
What time should you post? post when your audience is awake
How often should you post in a week? However much you can and still be consistent in regularity and quality
Should you use a content calendar? Only if you want to add friction for no real benefit.
Schedulers
Can I use a scheduler? Yes, but posting manually does ACTUALLY give your video a better chance.
Hashtags, Captions, Thumbnails
Does my video need a thumbnail? No
What hashtags should I use? Any 3 hashtags relevant to your video
What should I write in my caption? Short, sweet, with a few keywords

What time should you post? 

People have very strong opinions on this, and there;s many different theories. In general, it’s good to find a time when your audience is awake. For me, I’ve got a combo of US and UK audience, and find that evenings around 4-7pm work great. 


How often should you post per day? 

Once a day is ideal, and generally what I aim for. 2 times a day maximum. Any more than that and the algorithm might flag your account as spam. 

How should you lay out a posting schedule?


I like to schedule my videos on metricool, and make sure to lay out videos so not too many of the same bucket are coming one after another, its good to spread them out. As a general rule, videos do worse on weekends, so save the heavy hitters for the weekdays. 

Using a Scheduler

Good to note here too that although schedulers offer auto posting, you should post every video manually or it gets flagged and is restricted in the algorithm. 

What should you do after you post? 

Engage. It’s great to get a community of people who can like, comment and save and share the video to give it that first boost. It's also good to check into the comments every so often ad respond to keep the comment section alive and well.



Metrics

Introduction to metrics

Lightning fast metrics basics then – but you’re not going to learn that way.

Ok so you’ve posted, it’s flopped, and now it’s time for the autopsy (magnifying glass) – luckily when something kills a video it leaves behind tons of forensic evidence.

We’re gonna go through a bunch of unfortunate situations and find out just what went wrong.

Shares

[example] not shareable. 
A shareable video is [example]

Comments

[example] not commetable 
A commentable video is [example] 

Saves

[example] not saveable
A saveable video is [example]

Retention 

Also great to always look through this graph here, which is the average retention. A bad video will look like these, see everyones gone as early as possible (your hook didn’t work). A pretty good video looks like this. Of course you’ll still see that initial drop off, but more people are staying longer. This is a sign your hook worked, and your continuing to rehook people throughout and keep them till the end. 

So, what makes a good video?

Each platform varies on what a good video is. They each prioritise different metrics, and that’s why you should have a completely different approach to each one. 

TikTok

This platform favours watchtime: both how long the video is, and how long people watch it for. 

If you were to post a 5 minute video that most people watched the whole way through? TikTok would love it. 

If you were to post a 10 second video that most people don’t watch the whole way through? TikTok isn’t going to push it anywhere. 

If you end up on the creator program, your videos need to be at least a minute long to generate any revenue. 

In general I try to make most videos fit around the 1 minute mark. Any longer and your retention will drop (which is bad for the algorithm) and any shorter, the algorithm doesn’t favour it. 

Instagram

Now instagram is the complete opposite of that. 

Instagram favours short, aesthetic text style posts. Long talky videos tend to perform worse. 

Shorts
So you’ve gone viral…

Use the opportunity. 

On instagram start posting stories – this might be an opportunity to further promote yourself or even your product.

But there’s still one problem – you’ve barely gained any followers…

Getting followers

That’s really what we’re after, the numbers, the badge of honour for our account and the nucleus of our credibility – for what’s a million views without a million fans? 

Now what you have to understand is that followers are not what they used to be 10 years ago, thanks to the prevalence of the ‘for you’ feed, and further, 

And the difference between the platforms, specifically the meta platforms and the other two, means people follow for different reasons.

On the meta platforms, a follow is like a person inviting you into their home, letting you talk with their friends and family, and putting your picture up on the wall, with your names as the fourth commandment right after live laugh love. So people are guarded with who they follow, it needs to be content that would be welcome on their feed, but also be representative of an aspect of their identity. (The same can be said but even more extreme for Linked In)

Whereas, on TikTok and Youtube, people don’t have so many friends and family members following them, and due to the recommendation algorithm, following someone is less of a commitment to see more of that person's content, but, in contrast, this means that the boost you get from being niched on an interest that people may want to identify with is less prevalent, and it means your ability to entertain takes the centre stage.


Followers on IG vs TikTok
Instagram followers really matter, and people know this – if they follow you they’re gonna have to see your stories, a lot of your posts, and get recommended content by similar creators to you. 

Basics Structure:
Introduction:
As this video is the basics, we’ll be focused entirely on getting videos that get outsized returns – for specifics on how this fits into a conversion funnel, more of that will be in the advanced course.
The goal is two-fold, 1. get lots and lots of views 2. Become ‘the guy who…’ not ‘one of those’
Why is short form video a different beast to Linked In
Setting up an account (same from beginners course, with more on branding)
Each platform individually

Pillars:
You may already have pillars for your brand, and they may function already on the editorial platforms.
Self/Sale are similar, depending on the goal of your account, to become an influencer or to sell a product – although they’re kind of the same thing, if you’re building your character with your audience, really you’re just working on selling your future sponsorship endorsements.
– or, it’s good to have yourself throughout as much of your content as possible, especially in the game of wanting to be an authority figure in your niche, whatever that may be.

The most generally applicable ratio, I think, is 30% broad, 40% focused, 20% niche, and 10% sale. ( oh look, what do you know, it looks like a funnel doesn’t it)
Awareness (30%) – alignment (40%) (your face and your niche) – authority(20%) – cash (10%).
With this ratio you don’t have so much broad content that you’re getting in just the wrong type of followers – you’re main output is focused content, then 20% is the super niche stuff, and that leaves room for 10% to be specifically pushing a purchase.

Now you can meddle with these ratios all you want depending on your specific goals. If you’re just going for ad revenue and you’re just looking to be an entertainer, then pump the broad content, if you’re doing a big marketing push for a new offering, then pump the niche stuff and the sales.

Buckets:
Researching your competitors (what they’re doing, what’s going well, what’s not working) maybe do this last so that more ideas flow naturally and you don’t put yourself in a creative box, ‘the guy who…’
Give loads of examples
Buckets on TikTok vs instagram
Use visual of a venn diagram to show the overlap (when we do clients our bigger package is for around 10 videos a week – 3 IG exclusives, 3 TT exclusives, if one goes huge on one platform then repost

Pillars + Formats = Buckets
Pillars are the guiding principles, beliefs and personality of your brand, formats are the inherent

Topics are the things to make videos about  – 
Formats are ways to frame a video – 
Buckets are unique to your channels, it’s the 3 or 4 types of video you make, which will usually be one of your pillars, packaged in a pre-validated format.

Need lots of examples


Hooks
Framing
Hooks are the framing for your video, they set the entire tone of understanding, it is more than just what you script, it is everything that happens within the first 3-5 seconds of your video. 

*specific to Chris course*
A big mistake a lot of people make, especially founder/entrepreneur types coming from a familiarity with Linked In is ASSUME that the audience knows a lot of things about them.
They assume the audience know anything about them and say things like ‘if I could start all over again, these would be the changes I’d make
They assume the audience care about what they’re saying, and say things like ‘here’s the best marketing strategy…’
But worst of all, they assume that what they have to say is SO valuable, that people will just naturally be drawn to it.

Now I shouldn’t be the first to tell you, that when you assume, you make an ass out of u and me. In fact the only thing we can assume is that the audience is a blank slate, a Tabula Rasa with a slight disposition toward certain topics – but they don’t know who you are, they don’t know why what you’re saying is interesting, and they definitely don’t know why they should care [write on board]

So this is the first axis of a good hook, Authority

Here’s a few ways to get it into your hook:


Then intrigue
Intrigue doesn’t just mean being ‘mysterious’
Better to be upfront with more details than to be vague, think about how when you tell a story to friends. What perks you up more: 
“Hey, did I tell you about the craziest thing that ever happened to me?”
“Hey, did you hear about the time I was locked up in a swiss prison for treason?”

Obviously the second, because the hook has promised specifically how crazy the story could be. Where the first sounds relative, it’s hyperbolic, and sounds like bullshit.

Knowing more details is oftentimes more intriguing than knowing less, up to a point of course. Outside of convincing your friends to listen to your story, news headlines are also very good at striking the perfect balance between enough detail to capture your attention, and little enough to incline you to read on further.

Clarity
Most important, even more important than the other two things, clarity
When people are scrolling on social media, they're in a passive state.

Now what you have to understand is that followers are not what they used to be 10 years ago, thanks to the prevalence of the ‘for you’ feed, and further,

Instagram followers really matter, and people know this – if they follow you they’re gonna have to see your stories, a lot of your posts, and get recommended content by similar creators to you. 

The Frame
This lesson’s all about what’s actually put on the screen, 

Any cinematographer will tell you that the way you light, frame, and cut things will communicate a message to your viewer, and it’s their job to make sure that the message being sent visually aligns with the intended message of the video.

So quite simply, we’ve got our rectangle here which represents the phone screen, and bit by bit we’re going to look at what needs to go where.

First, absolutely the number 1 step, we need to account for the GUI interfaces of the different social media platforms. Unlike YouTube or other editorial platforms, The engagement buttons, the description, and even the search bar appear on the video itself, obstructing your lovely video. Yes viewers can technically turn it off, but let’s be real, they seldom will.

So let’s account for that. First we know there are engagement buttons along the right side of the screen, so we don’t want to put anything important there. Then the video’s caption usually goes somewhere around here, plus some platforms have a follow button here, some platforms have an ad down here, or here – so we can just discount that entire area. Then some phones have a notch right here so that’s in the way – and we can’t forget about the search bar here, oh and that weird TikTok shop button that’s sometimes going on up here – oh and don’t forget, most platforms have a slight horizontal crop – meaning the edges of your video aren’t here, they’re here.

So with all that crossed out, that leaves us with this area – the only parts of the screen we can guarantee will be visible. And this area generally has a name – the ‘safe zone’. By the way, for those of you editing your videos on a computer, I’ve included this safe zone as a png overlay in the downloads section of this module.

But ok great, this is progress, we know where we should and shouldn’t put things.

Next we gotta talk about the order of importance.

So, whatever the most important detail of your video is, should go in this general area – the visual centre.

This is where we need to tap into a bit of design theory – so in short – one principle goal of design is to draw a viewer’s eye to the most important detail first, the second most important second, the third… and so on.
The easiest way to do this is simply to put the most important detail where the eye is already looking, and people usually first look an image in it’s visual centre

The visual centre is different from the geometric centre, basically, in short, people perceive the centre of a page to be slightly above where it actually, mathematically is.

Hence why you want to put your key detail in this area.

Then, one more vitally important thing, is to keep everything simple. You don’t want subtitles that move all over the place, while also needing people to look at what’s happening in the video, while also reading some text on screen. It’s important to keep everything clean, only use graphics when they really help tell the story.

Video is a visual medium, which means visuals should support the message and give it the best possible chance to shine, not fight against it. 

Keep things simple, clean, and coherent.

And here's some even more that I've written

Week 1
Getting familiar with your analytics
Intro
Analytics are crucial as they provide the only insight into how viewers interact with your content and reflect their responses to your videos. Understanding different engagement metrics helps us see what works and what doesn't since algorithms focus solely on maximizing viewership duration on the platform.
Views
On short-form platforms like TikTok, views are more about initial impressions rather than full engagements. A single view means the algorithm has shown your video to someone, testing if it should broaden its reach depending on engagement. If a video doesn’t engage initially, it can quickly stagnate.
Some of the platforms like facebook and youtube split views into ‘3 second views’ and ‘actual views’ which is helpful but not super relevant.
Likes
Likes are a basic yet vital engagement metric. They can range from mild approval to accidental touches. Maintaining a like-to-view ratio above 10% generally indicates successful content engagement.
Favorites
Favorites or saves usually signify content worth revisiting, often containing useful information or tips. High favorites might mean your content offers actionable value that viewers plan to use later, though it might also indicate niche appeal that doesn’t translate to broader likability.
Comments
Comments are very important to a successful video.
People comment for five main reasons: to celebrate, to correct, to clarify, to joke, and to argue. 

Comments take time to write, and while people write your video continues to play.

People also start to read comments when you have enough of them, which adds another dimension of value for viewers - now they’re not just consuming your video, they can enjoy and interact with a whole thriving ecosystem of conversations. 

This means people spend way more of their scrolling time on your video, which looks amazing to an algorithm.

What does a healthy comment section look like?
A healthy comment section is one where people comment something that adds new meaning to your video, whether it is a correction, a joke, or an adversarial opinion, and because all of these comments add new meaning to the video, they themselves start to get likes and comments.

This creates a spiral of engagement: the more comments you have, the more comments you get, and the more time viewers spend in the comments, which ultimately means more time spent on the platform which every.single platform rewards heavily.

Comments are truly SO important - if you’re making videos that don’t inspire anyone to add to the conversation, you’ll struggle to get anywhere at all.
Shares
A share is like gold dust to any algorithm. Why? Because it not only shows a viewer really enjoyed your video, but they liked it so much that they are now bringing a friend off of whatever app they are on, and onto the algorithm’s platform, which makes them more money. 
Shares come from being interesting, but also prompting someone to want to experience the video with someone else. These funny videos do well - people want a shared experience.

Ideally you want something upfront, as close to the start of a video that relates to personal experience or characteristics. I’ve found a good way to do this is by starting a video about an area of interest that is broad, but people THINK is narrow, like film, conspiracy theories, YouTubers, Gaming, celebrities. Shares often come from either a ‘lol this made me think of you’ or ‘this is crazy i want to talk about this later, and also it made me think of you’. You don’t have to stick your most shareable detail upfront, but ideally you stick one upfront - and then have something even more shocking, or shareable later on.

Shares will drive the most views for you, in any algorithm - so always be thinking ‘who would share this to a friend.’
I always try to stick something relatable, human, and shareable upfront in my videos.

Now we go into the behind the scenes metrics - all platforms have their own versions of these, but I will use TikTok’s in the mean time as it is the clear, responsive, and easy to understand.
Conversion to Followers

Understanding follower conversion metrics is key. While follower farming can skew these numbers, generally, a high like-to-follow ratio signals high-value content. To boost follower count:
Create standout content that surpasses your competition.
Ask for follows strategically, not at the video's end but around the midpoint to keep viewers engaged. Examples of effective calls to action include:
"If you've watched this far, you clearly care about X, so drop me a follow."
"If you like this, follow me because I’m going to show you how to become rich."
"10,000 people are already getting value about [X] every day, so don’t miss out."
I have found that conversion to followers makes a big difference in the multitude of viewers a video gets. I’ve seen it be the only observable difference between a video that gets 100k vs 1 million, or 1 million vs 10 million - so it is important to get it into your script.
Retention Rates

Retention rate is the most critical metric, indicated by how long viewers watch your videos. Analyzing retention involves:
Watching the retention graph that shows viewer drop-off points.
Aiming for high and consistent viewer retention beyond the initial dip at the start of videos.
Noting average watch time and completion rates to understand engagement depth.
Identifying content issues through dips in retention at specific video segments.
Adjust content based on these insights to improve viewer retention and engagement. Analyze hooks and main content segments to ensure they hold viewer interest without turning them away. Common pitfalls include overly strong sales messages, slow pacing, and unnecessary repetition.
Overall, optimizing for these advanced analytics will greatly enhance your understanding of audience behavior and content performance, guiding better content strategies and viewer engagement.
Demographics


Platforms allow you to analyze the demographics of your viewers, helping tailor content to the ideal audience. If your actual viewers differ from your target demographic, consider pivoting your strategy. Understand your audience's location, age, and gender to optimize content timing and relevance—for instance, scheduling posts for peak times in viewer-dense regions like Australia.



Getting Ideas - The Smart Way
Now that you understand your metrics, competition, and the type of content you want to make, it's time to generate ideas effectively. Instead of trying to come up with a new idea daily, which is unlikely to consistently yield viral results, consider these two main strategies: Trends or Current Affairs and Prevalidated Content.
1. Trends / Current Affairs

Engage in 'trend jacking' by aligning your content with currently trending topics, which could be in pop culture, social media, or current events. This taps into the immediacy of social media and the inherent intrigue people have with ongoing topics. To find these trends:
TikTok Search Suggestions: Check what’s trending based on TikTok’s recommendations. These can guide you to topics that are currently capturing public interest.
Google Trends: Use this tool to identify trending search queries and topics globally. Check term popularity, regional interests, and related queries to gauge what's capturing attention.
Newsletters and Magazines: Subscribe to niche-specific and general publications to keep informed on topics that resonate with your target audience.
Twitter: Monitor trending hashtags and topics on Twitter to gauge what conversations are engaging people. This platform can serve as a quick testing ground for your ideas.

2. Prevalidated Content
Reddit: Explore subreddits related to your niche to find highly upvoted posts that resonate with that community. These topics are likely to interest your audience as well.
Popular Videos in Other Niches: Monitor what's working in your niche and adjacent niches. Look for videos with high engagement and consider adapting their successful elements to your content.
Analyze Your Successful Videos: Review your own past content that performed well. Identify elements that worked and consider how you can replicate these aspects in new videos.
By focusing on these strategies, you can streamline your creative process and consistently generate content that is more likely to engage and resonate with your audience. This approach not only saves time but also increases the potential for your content to go viral.

Researching the Competition
Introduction
When starting out with video channels, recognize that competition is inevitable and beneficial. Competitors provide insights into what works and what doesn’t, serving as a gauge for your own strategies.
Define Your Niche
Identify your niche clearly—it defines the genre of your videos, whether it's fitness, entrepreneurship, cooking, or any other. This understanding shapes the content you create and targets your audience more precisely.
Discover Competitors
Search for creators in your niche, focusing not just on the most popular ones but on those gaining views and engagement rapidly. Avoid comparing yourself with the largest accounts that may no longer be growing. Instead, target those with recent, successful content.
Analyze Competitors
Watch competitors’ videos to analyze style, length, topics, and engagement strategies. Pay close attention to the emotional impact of their content and how it engages viewers. This emotional connection is often a key driver of virality.
Analyze the Conversation
Examine the comments section for deeper insights into what makes these videos successful. Comments can reveal viewer engagement on specific details or overall sentiment. Also, explore related forums or subreddits if available, to understand why fans appreciate their content.
Tools for Deeper Insights
Utilize tools like Social Blade, VidIQ, and TubeBuddy, TokAudit to get detailed analytics and trends in your niche. These tools help track growth trends and provide competitor analysis.
Monitor Regularly
Regular monitoring of your niche and competitors is crucial, especially as you begin to see success. Stay updated with new trends and changes in viewer preferences.
Conclusion
Understanding how to research your competition equips you with the knowledge to refine your content strategy and create engaging, original content that resonates with your audience. This ongoing process is vital for growth and relevance in the dynamic landscape of social media.

Week 2
History of Hooks in media
Hello, I hope you are well - welcome to week 2.
This week is all about creating hooks that engage people from the very start of your videos.

But let’s not get ahead - thinking about viral video hooks as something ‘new’ or ‘modern’ is only going to blind us to all the sources of inspiration we take into account.

Hooks are nothing new, in fact they’ve existed for as long as people have wanted to direct the attention of others toward a certain thing. It’s nothing more than being able to manipulate intrigue.

There are examples of hooks in every medium we’ve all the way up to the short form video, you can see examples of them in

Books
Television
Film trailers
Billboards
Newspapers
Even philosophical essays

Every single piece of media throughout history has always had to stick out from the swath of media that surrounds it. On a bookshelf, you look at the book with the most interesting title - You go watch the film that had a really captivating trailer, and you read the article that had the best headline.

Without a hook, your content is nothing, it doesn’t exist.

If a piece of content falls in the woods, and no one is around to watch it, did it even get posted?

There’s a famous quote by ‘The Father of Advertising’ David Ogilvy that really captures this well, and I want you to remember this:
“On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar.”

This is eerily accurate for organic social content, almost down to the percentage

What Ogilvy meant by this is that your hook IS the only thing that almost EVERYONE sees - some people will look at it no matter what and all you have to do is interest them enough to not look away.

So it’s important to understand the hooks to our viral video as nothing more that something through which we can spark intrigue, and promise satisfaction to those who continue watching. Everything you do on social media must be interesting, this is imperative. If you want to be an educator this is especially interesting, as people in their passive state are rarely looking to learn - so you need to make it interesting.

Another good quote by david ogilvy also puts this succinctly as ‘you cannot bore people into buying your product; you can only interest them in buying it’

So let’s move onto the fundamentals of making a good hook

Hook Writing Fundamentals
Introduction
A good hook is simple yet intriguing; it promises and provokes thought without revealing too much at once.
Building Blocks of an Effective Hook
Intrigue:
Intrigue is the core of a captivating hook. It teases the audience with enough information to spark interest but leaves them wanting more. This approach ensures viewers are drawn in and stay curious throughout the video. 
I’ve seen a lot of failing creators misunderstand intrigue. They think it’s enough to be Questioning something. (e.g How did tupperware become so popular?);
say something random (e.g ;
or say something mediocrely controversial (e.g People shouldn’t work from home… everyday);
No one cares. 
To be intriguing you need to give the core of your video away immediately, like a headline. ‘A man in Dallas Texas just got decapitated while trying groom his dog.’ even though it FEELS like you’ve given the whole story away, people’s curiosity takes over as they need to find out how such a wild thing happened.
Being intriguing, at least in my experience, is less through mysterious questions, and more through big sensationalized statements, that you slowly give the details to.

Other pitfalls I see are being too clearly click bait - saying things like ‘Number 4 will shock you’ or ‘Watch until the end for a huge surprise’ - it just seems disingenuous, and viewers don’t find it intriguing.
Questions:
An effective hook plants questions in the viewer’s mind, making them NEED to watch for answers. There’s actually a psychological principle, called the Zeigarnik effect, which suggests that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones.
Whether you explicitly ask a question ("How did this man earn $1,000,000 with a toothbrush?") or plant question in the viewer ("I’ve just done the most embarrassing thing"), your viewer needs to have a debilitating need for answers to at least several questions.
Clarity:
Clarity is crucial, especially in short-form videos. Your hook should immediately make clear what the video is about and why the viewer should care. The topic of your video should be understood by a drunk man falling asleep, a child with ADHD, . This links back into intrigue, but viewers need to know EXACTLY what they’re watching immediately - no one is intrigued by something confusing. People are intrigued when they understand what’s in front of them, and want to know even more.
Clarity is key - something like ‘you’re making eggs all wrong’ is wasting time - whereas ‘we’re making eggs like this, because it actually protects you from cancer’ is intriguing. Plus, I think negative hooks that start with ‘stop, youre doing X wrong, dont do this’ etc are just tacky, turn away your audience, and is generally just bad vibes.
Energy:
Your energy is so important in a hook. You’re trying to invite an audience IN, not scare them away. Lots of people SOUND like they’re reading a script. I know you probably will be, but that’s no excuse to sound like it. There’s something important to note here – I have seen every mediocre creator fail to understand this when they’re videos start doing bad.

Basically – a creator will go viral for some hacky series, or they get lucky, maybe they have a few hundred thousand extra followers. Then, their views drop off - they don’t realise they just know fuck all about making good videos, so they blame attention spans, and ‘kids these days’, and in an effort to entertain this perceived crowd - they start acting like they’re mr.Beast. And usually creators that dont understand this space are 30 or older, so it’s not a good look.

By go full mr.Beast, I mean they just start shouting. Or jumping around, or making weird facial expressions. It’s bad.

Energy doesnt mean more - there’s not a linear increase in results. Energy just means natural - the more natural you speak the better people want to listen. You really gotta practice speaking to the camera like it’s a person, like you’re telling them a super interesting story you just heard.

Notes on Scripting.
My chapter on scripting is relatively short, partly because this is a small workshop, and if I included everything I ever learnt this would be a 12 week course, and who can be arsed with that.

But mostly because, for me, the day I started writing good hooks, was the day I started writing good scripts. Because it is the same skill.

Writing a script is just about opening and closing curiosity loops with surgical precision - and this basically means your script just ends up a matrix of interwoven hooks and payoffs that at some point ends just before the audience starts to get bored.

What do I mean by curiosity loop? A curiosity loop is essentially just anything that makes people… curious - the hook at the start of your video will most likely open a curiosity loop - and most (bad) content creators assume that you should satisfy that hook by the end, This makes your video just one looooong curiosity loop that’s probably dragged out to about the minute mark, and then abruptly ends – these videos are made by the sort of creators that do those time wasting techniques, hit you with a really strong hook and just start yapping.

I once helped someone with a tiktok that said something like ‘Logan Paul has just made the biggest mistake ever’ and then immediately went ‘logan paul is a youtuber who was born in 1996 in a small american..’ and then asked me why I thought people were dropping off at 5 seconds.

One hook is rarely enough to sustain someone for a whole minute, especially not the 3 minute runtimes we’re looking at trying to hit these days.

When writing a script, your hook should directly lead into the first thing you say, otherwise you’re wasting people’s time. While delivering on the hook, you can use that as an opportunity to open another curiosity loop, then you can deliver.

There’s a great scene from malcolm in the middle that illustrates sort of how you want your viewer to feel going through their video,

So like that but making sure at the end of the video, the viewer actually has all those questions answered. 

Each time you open a new loop, immediately start delivering on it, then open a new loop, and start talking about that.

Some creators use a phrase similar to ‘but to understand that we need to use what we know about X’

OR

‘And we will get to that right after we deal with Y’

X and Y in those examples are both stand ins for something extremely captivating, shocking, and intriguing - basically another hook.

This also needs to all feel very natural too, like you are actually trying to get to the point, but there’s so much interesting stuff on the way that you have to go over to make the final closed loop all the more satisfying. Nothing should feel like a detour.

Let's go through a video from Christopher Clafflin, who is a creator who I think does this unbelievably well.

[go through the bently video]

The way I’ve found to do this is when writing my scripts - i go line by line, making sure there is either a question, or a intriguing statement every other line. Basically writing to the rhythm of 

open loop, explain, open loop, explain, open loop, explain, close loops, satisfy hook.

For my top 5 videos, it’s more simple. Open hook, open loop for number 5, close loop, open loop for 4, close loop - and then finally satisfying the hook one the viewer has got all 5 of the cases. The only issue here is once the viewer has number 1, they may start to drop off, so always make sure the last item on the list has the best curiosity loop open.

You generally should always try to script video with rising intensity and satisfaction - except for the beginning. The start of your video should be the second most exciting or interesting thing, and the end of your video the most exciting or interesting thing.

Finally I want to touch on where to put your call to actions.
I often sandwich these right before the most interesting part of the video, the end, but for more subtle CTAs the middle works too. I think you should always include a CTA - even if you just ask for followers. People often, as do i, forget to hit follow on a video that they’ve enjoyed and just need a little reminder - so try to stick this around a point you’ve been most entertaining. RIght at the end works but can seem a little tacked on.

Of course you want people to leave comments along the way - so maybe pepper in a couple things you don’t explain – as long as the viewer feels satisfied.

The Frame
Introduction
SHort form video is literally that, it is video. It is something for people to look at WAY more than it is something for people to listen to, or read. So spending all your time on ‘hooks’ and ‘scripting’ is only half the story. 

In sales you have the 55/38/7 rule to communication

Basically 55% of how much people like you is determined by non-verbal communication(facial expressions, body language), 38% vocal communication(how you carry your voice), and only 7% your words.

Pretty big proportions - only 7% of how much people like you is determined by your words

The same can be said about your long form content - people are watching it more than they are listening, viewers are watching because they want something to look at. This means it’s incredibly important that you utilize, as much as you can, the VISUAL part of the medium.
Everything that goes on in the framing of your video is extremely important, and there’s a lot of things to implement and to be thinking about that influence how viral you go. 
In this section we’ll go over:

Text Hooks;
Visual Hooks;
Visual Disruptions;
Visual Pacifiers;
& Body Language.

Framing
But first, some notes on framing in general.

First and foremost - it’s about clarity & simplicity.

Here’s a general rule with short form. If you look at your video, close one eye, and unfocus your vision, and don't understand what's going on, then someone watching drunk, half asleep, or on an iphone 4 - won't either.

As I mentioned in the hook section. You have millisecond to let a viewer understand what is happening in your video. It should be clear from your FIRST FRAME what is going on - where the viewers eye should be directed. People need to know immediately what they are in store for.

Look at reaction or stitch content.
Here we have a react - we know it’s a react because we have a person looking down at their phone, or a screen - which is in the same direction of a super imposed video. We know what the person is watching then, is the video on screen. Further we have a caption in the corner - and a text box that explains further and more immediately what the discussion following the react will be about.

Or, look at the sort of content that gets 100s of millions of views. Here we have a gave with very colourful designed elements - we, as the viewer, understand what we will see on this video.

A greenscreen is an effective way to do this - you can essentially put behind you a thumbnail of exactly what you’re talking about - Jason Pargin does this really well.

If your idea is hard to get across immediately in your hook, then you can help viewers understand, and more likely to watch, through your framing

A few general rules on Image framing:
- 	Simple, easy to understand. Have your subjects, and then reduce everything else - for example noise, mess, or distracting parts of the image make your video too complex.
Too much text is also a sin. There should only be a small amount of big,easy to read text.
Keep the most important details to the center, or just above the centre - this is where there’s the most space in the frame, and where a viewer’s eye is most likely to rest between videos. If you need to direct a viewers attention to a part of an image - use leading lines (like pointing) or movement to gesture towards it.
Use a safe zone guide to avoid putting important details under captions, or engagement buttons - it looks messy.

Basically - keep it simple, keep it obvious. Use every pixel at your disposal to make your videos as easy to watch as possible.
Text Hooks
A text hook takes advantage of the fact that most human brains can read simple words quicker than you can speak them - it’s just a text box on screen that appears at the start of your video
A few rules to a text hook:

Use simple words. Try to think in terms of road signs, these messages need to be understood incredibly quickly. They’re always BOLD and SIMPLE. Don’t use complex words or it’ll confuse your audience
Say something you haven’t said in your verbal hook. Repeating yourself is a waste. If you find your text hook is the same as your verbal hook, you may as well cut the verbal and get your video to the point quicker.
Keep the text high contrast and centered. My personal preference is the white background, black text presets available on both TikTok and Instagram - or a similar effect in your editing software

Any video where you’re just talking for the start should AT LEAST have a text hook. 
Visual Hooks
A visual hook is basically something on screen that implies a payoff. For example a board with pieces of information missing - unfinished construction work - a basketball net with balls being thrown at it. It’s a way of, without words, communicating what’s going to happen in the video.

I spoke about reaction clips before, and this is included, because people are expecting the payoff of the response.
Lists or compilations sometimes do this, I use timers in a lot of my videos, other creators leave the list on screen and slowly fill it in.
Cooking videos - you expect the payoff to be ‘how the thing turns into food’
Rug cleaning with ‘how does this become a nice rug’
Art videos will do this by showing a piece of art grow more complete in small increments - but the viewer knows the payoff will be a spectacle of a final image.

It’s more powerful than saying ‘this will happen by the end of the video’ because a visual hook is voiceless - a viewer wont think anyone told them to keep watching, but the subconscious part of their brain that needs to see things completed is keeping them glued to the screen.

This is something you can get creative with, and there are lots of ways to cut it. A very applicable version is like a ‘before-after’ style post. Tons of great barbers use this when they show off making their clients glow the fuck up. 

Beyond just hooks too, having something on screen in any part of your video that implies something else is coming keeps viewers glued. Compilations benefit from this - people wanting just one more - greenscreens do this too, showing off ‘just one more’ thing behind you, lists as well. 

Also remember ALL things your viewer is looking at when they watch. A lot of times, when a viewer get’s bored they will look at the caption of the video too. So video caption is another opportunity to tack people back onto the video - maybe by making reference to a much later point in the video.

Remember, the goal of a visual hook is to implicitly communicate to your audience, "Stick around, and you will see THIS happen." This strategy is crucial for engaging viewers and can dramatically increase the likelihood they watch your video to completion.

Visual Disruption
A visual disruption is a type of visual hook, but is more shocking, and oftentimes separate from the rest of the video’s content. Some people call this a pattern interrupt, but that’s a stupid name that doesn’t make any sense.

A visual disruption, in essence, is showing something weird, shocking, or intriguing as the first thing in your video, with the goal that people will stop scrolling out of shock.
It is different from a payoff visual hook as it doesn’t necessarily set up a payoff, or have any meaning at all, other than being a ‘shock’ to the system, and being wildly different enough to ‘interrupt’ the pattern of scrolling the viewer is in.

Ideally this is something related to your video, like showing the strangest part of a production process first, or the emotional highpoint from later in the video, or maybe it's an exaggerated dramatization of a common pain point in your target demographic.

Otherwise it can just be anything, as long as it’s truly weird and disruptive. Try not to fall into the trap of being overly clickbaity, people will catch on quick. 

Visual Pacifiers
A visual pacifier is effectively giving the audience something else to watch alongside your video - and when done right it’s extremely effective.

The most obvious example of this is slime content - but there are many other ways to utilise it. Some creators go through their script while they construct something with their hands, or they wrap a present, or they go for a walk, or they clean a surface, or cook food, or put on makeup, or play minecraft parkour. 

Now this may not work for your brand, or your content - and it doesn’t always. But the idea behind a visual pacifier is just giving your audience something to look at to maintain their attention. Choice of video editing and split screens does this too. When I edit my own videos, which are very talk-y, I make sure to have at least two things on screen at once. One, is me talking, the other is some sort of image or video for the audience to decipher.

By the time it’s been deciphered, I cut to a full for emphasis, or give them another picture or video. 

A good rule of thumb with this is the 5 second rule. If it’s been more than 5 seconds since something has changed visually - you might lose your audience.

These are the two most common ways I’ve seen to visually ‘pacify’ your audience. The more stimulation you can give them, the better - as long as you don’t confuse them. Much earlier in my career I would over edit every single thing on screen - but not only did it take way longer to make, it also confused viewers, and came across as less sincere.

This gives the viewer something that captures part of their attention AS WELL as your script - it won’t solve a bad video, but it can make a good video better.

Body Language
Your body language and facial performance is also CRUCIAL in keeping viewers.
Just like any situation in life, you need to have warm, inviting body language to make people want to spend the next couple minutes with you.
This also affects your camera distance, if your camera is way too close it’s uncomfortable, if too far away - it’s a little cold. Of course if you’re filming in selfie mode the distance that you should be from the camera changes to be what’s most appropriate for the format.
On that note too, a HUGE huge mistake creators make. Eye Contact - WAYY too much. You should look into the lens of your camera like you look into a person’s eyes, I.E  TAKE BREAKS. This is the issue with teleprompters, as they lock your eyes to the camera - it makes the viewer uncomfortable.

In my opinion, your visual hook is more important than whatever you’re saying. You want to present the viewer with a nice, clear image, a warm atmosphere, and a face they could imagine chatting to in real life, maybe over facetime or drinks. It also helps people look at you as more trustworthy, worth listening to, and more established over all.
Viral Formats
Viral Motifs to make scripting easier
Lists, Compilations, Green Screens, revealing/payoff, Visual pacifiers, stories, reacts, day in my life, story time

Lists
These tend to be top 10s, top fives, or that sort of thing. They’ll usually rank a group of items in order or least something, to the most something.

With lists, always make the first one in the video the most shareable, and the second most shocking. I know you may think they should be numbered in order - but the secret is, that’s totally false. If the first item on your list is boring, people will think you have a boring list - whereas having something exciting up front makes people wait through the next couple without noticing that the items are slightly out of order.

The topic you pick is important, the more creative you are with the category the better - for example 10 best films isn’t as interesting as 10 that were hugely controversial isnt as interesting as 10 films that were BANNED for being too RACIST
Compilations
Compilations, similar to lists although not ranked in any particular order, with no particular or set amount of sections.

Compilations will usually be lighthearted, a series of funny clips or pieces of media, presented by someone - commentary YouTubers will do this type of video often.

The key to success here is to make the first item or two on the compilation really quick, so that people know quickly that it's a compilation. Spending ages on the first one, people assume that that’s it.

Compilations work best with a visual aid and fairly quick pacing - remember the 5 second rule
Green Screens
Green screens are great to get started. They make it really easy to back up any claim to make yourself seem more authoritative eon a subject - or a great way to increase retention by showing a different image every few seconds.

With greenscreens I’d say they do best when what you’re talking about is made clearer from the green screen, but you’re not talking about the image behind you directly. 

Basically make sure your script adds more value than just the pictures, it’s not enough to just describe what is happening in the image.
Reveals and Payoffs
Reveals and payoffs are great. This is basically any type of content with an implied payoff.

Some people use a whiteboard – some people use emojis or text.

Before and After works here very well - if you can find a way to make that work with your content or niche.
Comparison
Comparison is another format I see do well consistently. Comparing two very similar items is just engaging, there’s something about it.

Here’s a video by Chris Donnelly comparing two videos of his that are
Stories
Stories were a format that did extremely well for me in the past - and there’s so many ways you can do it. I’d say with story videos, they need to feel ‘real’ otherwise people don’t care. They need to feel like anecdotes or something that was sent in. Why? Because Social Media is supposed to be a window into different realities.

A lot of female story time content creators will tell stories while they apply makeup, which acts as a visual pacifier. Other creators will read out stories from reddit users, or supposed ‘fans’.

I’d say with stories, the more outrageous the better, and the more real the better. Those are the two qualities a good story video will have.

It’s up to you how much you’re willing to be fictitious, but generally I will say to clients to ‘beef up’ an anecdote for the sake of retention, and then say it happened to a friend – it’s less about the actual truth of the anecdote, this is usually just a way to frame a point you want to make in an engaging way.
Reacts/Stitches
Reacts and stitches are an amazing content bucket to have in your repertoire - especially if the goal with the content is to become a personality, because reactionary content shows you off as in your ‘natural’ state. 

These videos should feel less scripted – and are significantly better for engagement and building your brand in general when 
Day in my life
Personally I see alot of day in my life posts, and they never seem to do that well – and it’s not something I’ve personally ever been tempted to try.
The most successful Day in my life posts are always, funny, snappy, and intriguing.

For example the hook ‘day in my life as a senior accountant’ is

Introduction Course
State what the lessons will be
Talk about premiere pro, and other options
Things like keybinds, and specific windows will not be relevant to you in a different editing program – but this workshop mostly covers theory of editing, and the best practises, which are applicable no matter what software you use.

There are fundamentals to this process that will outlive any tool you can use, and will take you further into a creative career as a videographer or creator.

This system was developed by me at a time where I had 30-35 high quality tiktoks to make a week for myself and my clients. I developed it over 2 years, incrementally making TINY adjustments that each save a small amount of time - although they all add up to HOURS being saved.

Now this is, what I think, the best way to make high quality short form, vertical, social media content.

We will go over small bits of viral theory throughout, but focus mostly on editing to a high standard, making videos that are most likely to get us views.

If a section only applies to Premiere Pro, I will put a warning and a timestamp in the bottom corner of the screen.

Whenever you see this screen - it’s something I think specifically you should make notes on

In the editing section I want you, in large part, to follow along with me – so I have provided footage you yourself can edit too.
I’d still recommend making notes during the video editing section of the course, so it’s best to take pauses throughout. Especially with lots of keybinds
Keybinds are so key to a quick video editing workflow. When I was still learning them I used to have some flashcards with every single keybind that I learnt on it - and I had one flashcard per app I used. You don’t have to be that anal about it - but it worked for me.

There are loads more, which I’ll say as we go through the editing process, but these are the most important for this particular workflow.
Project Setup
Hello, welcome to the bulk of this workshop - the actual EDITING. 

We’re doing file management and project set up. Please try to contain your excitement.No but seriously I know it sounds boring but this is probably the most important step you can do. 

If you don’t want to set up the project, I have included in the lesson files a version of a project already set up for you. But you should still follow along this lesson so that you can follow along.

So I find it best to have a premiere pro project PER CLIENT. If that’s just yourself then bully for you. Doing it this way may end up intensive on your computer, so make sure you clean it out often.

Go through preferences.
Display Colour management settings. Especially for Apple computers.
This is because most modern mac’s have a high dynamic range display, whereas most screens still have a rec709 display, or at the very least that’s how most services display videos - your timeline should be set to REC 709. This setting basically just means the display image more closely resembles how it would be displayed on a REC 709 screen.
Only select this is your screens colour gamut is different from rec 709 or sRGB


And then your project is good to go!
Folder Structures
A solid folder structure basically just keeps everything easy to find, and keeps it all neat and organised - and we want to be professionals about this.

Right so let's first make our client folder.
I tend to number all my important folders from 000 and upwards, this way all the important stuff is always in the same place on my computer.

Lets call it 000 - Client Name
Now lets make a folder called 000-ShortForm
In this folder lets make a folder called Batch Template
001-Media
002-AudioEXP
003-AudioENH
004-NoSubs
005-FinalExports

Now inside media we want to set up 3 folders
Same in our final exports folder we want
000-Finals
001-YouTubeShorts

Now we’ll get to know what the purpose of each of these folders is, but also as you explore your unique working style for your type of content, you’ll find that you may add or remove folders in this setup.

Filming
Welcome to the second lesson. We’re going over filming – Right now I am about to set up and film my newest batch of TikToks, so set up with me and I’ll go over what I personally do to get things looking crisp.

F1 - Camera
First is first, camera and camera settings.

I personally use the Lumix GH5, I shoot in LOG, 10 bit 422 codec - and I use the anamorphic setting that this camera has to shoot in 4 by 3 aspect ratio.
I use a 25mm fixed lens with a 1.7 aperture
I have a moment cinebloom 5% filter, and a neutral density filter attached to the lens with step up rings.

Ok, If you didn’t understand any of that, I’m going to go over it all now, bit by bit. If you understood ALL of that, then well done, and feel free to zoom ahead - but a refresher never hurt anyone.

Codec
Ok so, lumix GH5 - why do I like it
Because it records in Log, and 10 bit 422 codec. What does that mean - it basically means it retains A LOT of colour information.

Log basically means condensed colour format, which makes everything look desaturated and grey, but because of that - it compresses lots of colour information in the middle ranges

This is good because If I shoot with low exposure, or over exposed, I have way more chance of fixing it in post - and often this happens, because this is a very run and gun area to be in.

But Log tends to be worse at retaining this data unless shooting with a less colourful codec.
This is where the camera’s ability to shoot in 10 bits of colour is extremely useful.

Most and many consumer cameras will film in 8 bit - which stores 2 to the power of 8 (256) colours per channel - making a total of 16 million different colours.
SOunds like a lot, but 10 bit records 2 to the power of 10 (1,024) colours per channel - which is just over a billion colours.

If you don’t have a camera that can do this then don’t worry - it’s not essential. When it comes to editing it just gives us a LOT more options when it comes to fixing the image, and gives us smoother shadows. However, it does take up ALOT of storage - which isn’t always great. Even just a phone camera is completely fine - but does just give us less optionality in post - plus we’re trying to make our videos stand out, right? So I will be going over the high key tactics.

Another good thing about this camera is it shoots in 4-6k, which is good compared to a 1080p camera because we’re cropping into our image to make it vertical, which makes a 1080p image look a little rough.

Of course you can use a tripod that lets you turn your camera sideways, but then you need to make sure you don’t move around too much.

Basically I use a camera like the GH5 because it allows me to correct the majority of mistakes in post, if they arise - and nothing takes more time than reshoots - especially if it's client work.

Also this camera has an anamorphic setting. I wont go into specifically what that means because its not very relevant - but basically it means the image can be taller, instead of just 16:9 - even better for shooting vertical videos.

Lens
Ok so the lens - I use a very cheap lens because it’s good enough - here’s how you choose a lens.
This is a prime lens, meaning it doesn’t zoom in or out - it is set at a fixed focal distance, 25mm. Prime lenses usually have a wider aperture, this goes up to f1.7, and because it can’t zoom - stays consistent.

Ok so first, aperture.
Aperture is measured in f stops. Basically the smaller the f-stop, the wider the aperture. So f1.7 - wide. Take it down to f22 - thin aperture.

A wide aperture lets more light hit the sensor, so a lens with a wider aperture is good for low light conditions.
A wide aperture also, importantly, means a shallower depth of field. (this means a blurrier background, or that less of the image is in focus) - many people may like this because of the professional feel it has over, say, a phone camera, which has a tiny aperture so most of the image stays in focus.

I personally keep my aperture as wide as I can, because I prefer the image it gives me.

Moving on from aperture - focal distance
Focal distance is measured in millimetres, and basically determines the angle of what the camera can see.
A smaller focal distance means a wider image, very panoramic, and a higher focal distance is much narrower
Some may break this down into Wide Angle, Standard, and Telephoto. Zoom lenses will cover many focal distances, zooming in is effectively narrowing a camera angle
The differences are
Wider angles allow you to get cameras in small spaces, where as narrower lenses you need to be further away from the subject
Wider angles show more background, zoom lenses hide it
Wide angles compress the background, zoom lenses expand it
Wide angles thin out faces, telephoto shots fatten it up
Wide angles have less background blur or bokeh, telephoto shows more.
Wide can angles distort the edges of an image

When capturing a human face - it’s thought that the focal lengths of 35 - 70mm capture faces in a way most similar to how other people see them
Now you might have just said, but wait, Joden - why is your lens set to 25mm?
Ok, real quick - focal distance gets fucked up by different sensor sizes. My camera, the GH5, is a micro 4/3s sensor. There are 3 main sensor sizes you might come across
Full Frame - common on most DSLRs
APS-C or ‘Super 35’ which is found on some DSLRs and lots of film cameras
And Micro 4/3s - which is what I have. When most people talk about focal distance, they talk about it relative to a full frame sensor. To extrapolate it to other sensor sizes there’s a multiplication to be made.
For example, 
a 50mm lens on a full frame camera will look the same as 
A 33mm lens on an APS - C camera (as it is 1.5x smaller)
And a 25mm lens on MFT (as it is 2x smaller)

So depending on your sensor, these are the focal lengths you’ll want to consider for each sensor size. If you have less space in the room you film in, go for the wider side of the spectrum.

I go for 50m equivalent because it works for me, and it’s dead in the middle.

Alright - that’s basically everything you need to know about lenses. The other thing is, the more expensive they are, the sharper they probably are - but for social media purposes this isn’t necessary because of the compression most platforms put videos through. If I ever have a big project I’ll rent a lens - because they are way too expensive to buy.

Exposure

Finally lets go over exposure - this is probably the most important thing to get right. Now you can set your camera to auto exposure, sure. Although being less able to control the lighting conditions of your image makes it fluctuate wildly, and result in a worse image.

Basically there are 5 ways to control exposure in photography, although in videography we often have to lock those settings.

Lighting
First is obviously lighting. If they’re too bright, turn them down, if it’s too dark, turn them up. Simple as.

Shutter Speed
First is shutter speed. This is how quickly the camera takes a picture of a frame. A 
slow shutter speed takes a longer exposure, which means it lets light in for longer - making a brighter image. This results in more motion blur too. A shorter exposure means a darker image and less motion blur.
When shooting video, the natural amount of motion blur is around half the framerate - this is roughly what we perceive with our eyes.
So if you’re in the UK or most of europe, and you’re shooting 25fps, a natural shutter speed would be 1/50 seconds
In the US, you might be filming in 30fps, so you’d pick 1/60.
Your camera might also measure this in degrees. If so, set it at 180 degrees - basically meaning half the frame is exposed.
If you’re shooting in a higher frame rate for slow motion, you should increase the shutter speed.

Because we want the video to look natural, we can’t change shutter speed a lot to modify exposure. So we need another method

Aperture
As mentioned earlier, our lens’ aperture determines how much light hits the sensor. However, sometimes you have a shot where you can’t change the aperture. For example, maybe the blurry background is really important to how the shot looks - in that case you can’t make the image darker adjusting the aperture. Conversely if you have a shot where you want background and foreground in focus - but the image is too dark - you’re also stuck.

This is why the film citizen kane was groundbreaking, it featured many shots in ‘deep focus’, using a pinhole aperture to get foreground and background in shot. To get these the just had to use an absurd amount of light to counteract this.

ISO
The other thing is ISO, ISO is basically digitally adding exposure in the camera - so although you can take the ISO really high on a lot of cameras, but as more light isn’t getting into the camera, high ISO values will see the image starting to get noisy - my camera can go up to about 20000 ISO before looking really grainy

ISO is great when things are too dark, but your ISO will usually bottom out at around 400 - and sometimes that’s still too bright, especially working with daylight.

Neutral Density
Finally, a filmmakers best friend, Neutral density. This can effectively be thought of as a sunglasses for your camera. If you ever want smooth background blur while shooting outside - you’re gonna need a neutral density filter.

I recommend a variable ND filter, meaning it goes from not that dark, to super dark. My one covers 5 stops of exposure, which is usually enough.

When buying filters, make sure to choose an adequate filter size, as filters can be expensive. the filter size of your lens will be printed on the front of it for reference.
The majority of camera people will usually buy a given filter in the biggest size possible, and then get a step up ring for their lens.
82mm is the largest filter size, but the lenses I use have 46mm and 58mm threading. But instead of buying multiple filters, as they are expensive, I have purchased just one that I can use on any lens I ever buy with the use of step up rings.

Just food for thought.
Checking Exposure
Your camera will most likely have a way to see if your image is correctly exposed - for most shots I find this little exposure indicator is good to go off. But also most cameras will have a histogram, which tells you the luminance range. Generally you don't want anything blowing out either side, the curve should look generally centered. Of course some super bright windows in your background might skew the histogram.

Ok so now you know everything you need to about cameras, and how they work - go have a play around with your camera and familiarize yourself with all the settings inside of it.
F2 - Lighting

First lets talk about lighting, as it’s the most important visual element.
I use something called the Amaran 200x, 200 meaning 200 watt LED, and x meaning bi colour - meaning it can go from warm to cool tones, specifically 2700 to 6500k
I also use this with the Aputure light dome II, which is a round soft box that attaches to my light.
For other lights I use an Aputure 60d with a CTO gel, and an Amaran T2.
You’ll understand what all this means by the end of this lesson 100%

I’ll try to explain some stuff about lighting as simply and best I can.
Finding the shot
First thing you’re gonna want to do before setting up ANY lights, is find the shot.
Setting up lights takes time, so you need to know what you’re even lighting. Step one of any shot should always be finding the shot.

Once you’ve found some framing you like, and the spirit levels of the camera shows that you’re not wonky, then it’s time to think about lighting.
Soft vs Hard lighting
First we need to take about the difference between soft and hard lighting

Hard lighting is like sunlight, or lightbulbs - it’s generally unflattering as it casts harsh shadows, which shows wrinkles, or might wash out skin. It’s also much brighter generally

Soft -or diffuse- lighting is like a beauty mirror, or studio lights, or a cloudy day. It’s much more flattering because it doesn’t cast dark shadows. It’s generally regarded as more beautiful all around.

What makes a source soft? Simply size and distance. For example a soft box turns this hard, point source of light - which acts like a harsh source of light - and distributes it over a much larger area, making it softer - here’s a comparison for reference.

Another example is an open window. A window serves as a soft source of light as all the light from outside diffuses into the room at roughly even distribution - however when the sun get’s low and shines through the window, that’s now hard light.

Because softness is related to size of the light source, there’s a couple ways you can get softer lighting without having specifically a softbox or breaking the bank - You can reflect light off of a white surface - you can blast it through a bedsheet, or there are many LED panel lights that are fairly affordable, even tube lighting is softter than point source. 

But say you still need it cheaper.
You can use a lamp with a big lampshade and get it as close to your face as possible.
Or you can try to blast it through a big bedsheet. 
You may find you struggle with brightness however - but there are lots of options out there for people on a budget anyway. I know amaran does 100 watt lights and even 60 watt lights at extremely affordable prices.
The ring lights that a lot of influencers use are also very soft - however alot of these are extremely cheaply made, so beware of a nasty green or purple tint that as it can be a little flattering..

Remember, softness of light is way more important than brightness - you can adjust exposure in camera, but you can’t do anything with unflattering lighting.
Placement
Next, where you place your lights is very important

With the placement of our light, we are looking for what is most flattering, and what has the most contrast between subject and background.

We can solve both of these with the placement of our light. General rule you want to follow for talking head videos, set up your camera 45 degrees above and to the side of the subject. That’s half of a right angle. 
This ISN’T flattering for everyone, sometimes I find more around the 30 degree mark works best. Especially because with Social media you want the image to be easy to understand, so a better lit subject is good.

When it comes to contrast, angling your lights also affects this. Basically we want as little light to spill onto the wall behind as possible, keeping it dark in comparison to the subject.

Another thing we can do to increase contrast is to use hair lights or rim lights. These are lights you basically angle behind the subject, so that the very edges of their silhouette light up, this makes them sort of glow, and look a little more ‘unreal’ - in a good way.

I use 2 rim lights on either side as me. If i had the space in my flat, or the time - i’d set up a hairlight above and slightly behind me - these also really separate a subject from their backdrop

Also, look out for ‘raccoon eyes’. This is something I’ve messed up a few times in my career - it looks like this, and it’s where the subject eyes are extremely dark. it’s basically a feature of having a light that’s placed or angled too high up. 

Colour Temperature

Color temperature is measured in kelvin - referencing the colour of a black body radiator when heated to whatever kelvin… I know, sounds like bull shit - and it is! Here’s what you have to know

3200k is pretty common for ‘warm lighting’ my lights in my flat are roughly 3200k
5600k is considered ‘daylight’ specifically the colour of a cloudy day. Lights without bicolour option will always come in only 5600k or ‘daylight. Like this aputure 60d.
Further, 6-6.5k is roughly the temperature of a bright blue sunny day.

When shooting something, you don’t want to mixed coloured lighting. For example, a lot of office buildings I’ve shot in have lights around 4200k, so if I blast a light that’s 5600k, the shot falls apart
Being able to switch between these allows me to match the lighting of the room im in. This is NOT a necessary feature for 2 reasons.
1 - you can just turn off or cover any lights that interfere. By interfere I mean if they’re also lighting your subject
2 - You can buy things called gels, which take up or down the temperature of the light - for example, I have a 5600k spotlight, but I stick a full CT orange gel on it, and it becomes 3200k

Cheap LEDs and lights also have something called a tint, which is either a green or magenta shift. This is why I recommend buying expensive lighting, something made for film sets, that’s less likely to have this green or magenta tint - because it is extremely unflattering and will make you look gaunt.

Ok. I hope you’re still with me. 
For my key light (meaning light on the subject) I try to stick to 5600k because that’s what my camera’s white balance is set at.
Then I’ll have a rim light, or a hair light at 3200k, and another also at 5600k

Here’s a quick run down of my lighting equipment set up
Amaran 200x set to 5600k, with aputure  light dome II, 
Amaran T2C set to 5600k
Amaran 60d set to 3200k with a CTO gel
Manfrotto 52b
Some stand I found laying around
Box
F3 Audio
Finally, real quick, we’re looking at audio.

You want good audio quality, in fact it’s super important - people hate bad audio quality, it makes you impossible to listen to - so it’s never a good idea to record audio through your phone, or your camera.

Personally I don’t like, nor have the space for big expensive microphones - so I go for the lavalier microphone.

The one I still use to this day, is the rode smart lav plus. I use this because it is cheap, it plugs straight into my phone, and the audio quality is good enough

When recording audio, you want to check your levels and avoid clipping, i.e being too loud. Audio that clips/is too loud is basically impossible to recover - so its better to be under.

With a lavalier mic you want to make this sign with your hand, and place it on your chin. Wherever your pink finger lands is where you strap your lav mic. It can go under or over clothes.

The microphone will pick up other noise - but we’re gonna use the adobe enhance speech AI software to clean up our audio - but we will get to that later.

I have also used the rode go microphones, and they have really good quality and DON’T need the post processing. Although I find getting files from it slightly awkward, and I think it just looks a bit silly and distracting, but a lot of creators do use it.

Also it’s worth making sure your camera does also record audio, it makes syncing the tracks up much easier when we get to post.

F 4 Shooting
We’ve got our lights set up, our camera rolling, and our audio recording. It’s time to shoot.

I personally choose to have a desk in front of me so that I can use my laptop - which will have my script in front of me - and I start to read it out.

Personally I only very loosely stick to my script so that things feel more natural - and I recommend you do the same. Over my career I have seen a huge impact to views based on how charismatic and natural a creator seems in their videos. 

If you shoot videos and you seem too ‘scripty’, it’s likely to read as fake and make an audience disengage. This is why I choose to shoot without a teleprompter as well, because teleprompters still LOOK like you’re reading, and really you should set the pace to how you deliver your video.

If you work with clients, as I did for a long time, take the directorial role here. If they’re not being charismatic, you need to pump them up, hype them up - suggest doing a take without the script, and adjusting it on the fly if it doesn’t sound natural to them

Another thing - when you’re looking at the camera, make sure you’re looking AT the camera. Don’t pretend you’re on a podcast, it’s bad for views. Also if you’re recording yourself, don't look at the camera’s screen - train yourself to look down the lens, because that’s where the viewer is, and you want to establish that connection with them. I also think teleprompters sully this connection a little bit, but that’s just personal preference.

Not to keep barking orders, but you need to be a little bit decent at acting, or just have a natural energy… or… Charizzma. 

A lot of people misinterpret this as shouting - in fact - SO many creators think this means just start shouting. It doensn’t, you’re not mr.Beast, you’re probably not trying to entertain children, so shouting will not trick people into thinking you have charisma.

Basically you should be talking how you do naturally, but when you have a cool story to tell. That’s the tone that should always be in your head. Trust me 100%, you telling your friend a cool story you heard is the perfect tone.

Alright, so now just work through your script, if you mess up a line just go back and do it again. I personally do it line by line - memorise a line, say it correctly, rinse and repeat. It takes me 10 mins to record a video, but if your content is a reaction, or a rant, or something with an easier script, you’ll probably take no time at all.

When you're done, cut the camera and the audio and go again.


Ending
Ok, that was very hard, I acknowledge that - but not only are you done filming your videos, but you also learnt a hell of a lot about camera settings, which is pretty sick.

Of course you might have more intense, or less intense videos - you might have multiple angles for each video

If that’s the case - always shoot everything you need at one angle before changing angle - even if this means you film your videos or shots out of order - it will save you loads of time, and you can plan accordingly.








Offload and Sequence
Ok hell yeah, we’re all done with filming, now it’s time to get our footage onto our computers for the topic of the BULK of this workshop - the EDITING.

First step to me is sequencing, this is basically getting all our videos into separate sequences, ready to edit.

Let’s whack in our SD card, get all of our footage and stick it into MEDIA, FOOTAGE
And lets get our audio recording and stick it in AUDIO. And now we wait - as theres quite a few gigabytes of footage.
Usually at this point I would do other tasks as this can take 40 minutes sometimes, like fill up my other media folder - but because I don’t want to overwhelm you we will do one thing at a time.

Ok it’s done so lets open up our Premiere Pro project, and create a new folder. I’m going to name it 001 for batch 1, then the client’s name, which is me, and then ‘ALL SEQ’
Im gonna drag these two folders into this one

Get footage put on all footage
Get audio put on all footage
Sync all audio
Colour Grade (go over vectorscopes)
Delete audio channel
Add markers
Put footage next to each other if part of same video
Duplicate templates
Copy and paste into each sequence
Export all sequences as Wave
Enhance speech
(id also do some other stuff here, to keep things moving)
Bring audio into the project on channel 1

And Thats the offload and sequence step - all videos are ready to get stuck into. I usually have a 10 minute break here

Old course transcripts:
 So in this section, we're going to go over your analytics. Um, we're going to go over what each individual metric on your video means. And we're also going to touch on how each one is optimized. So, you know, we're going to go over likes and then we'll go over how you can get more likes, and then we'll do the same for comments all the way down to upping your retention rate, which is ultimately the most important.

So what are analytics? Analytics are the information about your videos that viewers can't see. It's information that's. It's particularly useful to creators to know what they're doing wrong, what they're doing right. Uh, it just gives you more insight into what's going on. Analytics are things like the number of likes, the number of views, the number of comments, the amount of time people watched for, what countries people were watching from, the amount of shares, uh, where traffic is coming from.

Analytics can be any information and each platform gives you a certain, uh, a certain Uh, it gives you different analytics to go off of, basically. Some platforms give you very little, uh, like Instagram, but then some give you really loads, like YouTube, and then some are just in the middle, like TikTok and Facebook Reels.

But all platforms have them, and they all provide them, and you should check them on all platforms. Why should you check them? That's an excellent question. Analytics give you the most lucid insight into your viewer's mind. Unless it's comments, then you can kind of tell what they're thinking. But reading our analytics, uh, especially on videos that haven't performed how we want to, lets us know what we're doing wrong, basically.

And it lets us know what our audience thinks, and what our audience doesn't like about the video. Maximizing those metrics, um, both appeases  the audience the most, unless it gives them the doubt.  Viewer experience, which is what we want, but also it makes us better creators. It makes us understand.  What people actually want to see and what we just think they want to see because we're so special and we know best.

So your analytics do have a relationship with the algorithm of each platform. All the algorithms look for slightly different things, but generally they're just trying to increase the amount of time a viewer stays on the platform. So analytics that can note a viewer experience that makes them more likely to stay on the platform or bring other people onto the platform will have a stronger weighting in whether or not a video goes viral.

Thanks a lot. But we will get to that. So we're just gonna work up through all the analytics and do them one by one. The first analytic is obviously views. So on the short form platforms, views are more like impressions. Which means, uh, an impression just means it's come up on someone's screen. Think when you scroll Google or scroll YouTube.

All those videos you don't click, you've still given an impression. Now in short form, everything comes up on the feed as a scrolling feed. So every video you watch is effectively an impression, and deciding to click is passing that three or five second mark. Now platforms like Facebook, and I think YouTube as well, separate views into different categories.

I think Facebook does it. 5 second views, 30 second views, and a minute views. Um,  TikTok doesn't separate them at all. Your views on TikTok can be 1 second views, they can be a thousand views, it's just the amount of people the video was shown to. Not necessarily the amount of people that actually watched any of it.

In fact, on TikTok, if people watch the whole video, and then it loops round, that counts as another view as well. So,  it, the amount of views on the platforms just really aren't a good indicator of  But it's important to note that views, views are lead in the sense that views are determined by the amount of People the algorithm decided to show your video to to simplify that basically on every platform When you post a video an algorithm shows it to a small pool of people Especially if you're a new new creator and you don't have a lot of fans followers It shows it to a small group of people on tiktok.

This is Famously 200, uh, but all the platforms have different amounts. Then, in that first pool, it looks at how people saw the video. How did they engage? What metrics did they hit? And if it hits an unknown quota of those metrics, it then goes to 10, 000 people. And then if it hits the metrics again, now you're at 100 and then a million.

And so on, all the way, sky is the limit. So if you get 200 views and then suddenly get 10, 000 views, um, your videos is, I mean, it is blowing up, but it's not like, the algorithm is just choosing to show it to more people, if that makes sense. So all views is, is the maximum amount of people the algorithm tested it on before it stopped getting the returns it wanted on, uh, viewership on metrics.

So because of this, I mean, it's great to say I got a million views, but realistically, a million views Maybe 300, 000 people watched your video, which is still a lot, but it's not a million. Next big metric is likes. Uh, likes have been around as long as man has been looking at things on the internet. It's a very simple metric, and to be honest, doesn't really make much of a difference.

A like can be, every person has different liking behavior. Uh, people could accidentally be hitting the screen. Or they could be intentionally liking it and love the video. But a like doesn't really mean much. It is good, and each platform there's a different ratio for how many likes you should be getting when your video first goes out.

On TikTok like 0. 9%. And on YouTube it's, it varies a lot actually, I'm not too sure. You've probably already heard that, that it doesn't really mean anything. It's just a good way to gauge, um, are people liking the video, you know? Uh, so likes don't really mean anything. Obviously, you should be hitting those, uh, percentages, ratio percentages.

Um, but it's just, it's, yeah, it's, the way you optimize for likes is just by having a good video. The next metric is favorites or saves. Um, this used to be like a star icon on most apps, but it's now like this bookmark icon. What this means is like, some people may use it as a super like, because it's technically favorites, Favorites, but that's not what most people use it for.

In my experience, if you get a lot of saves on a video, it just means it's a video that people think is worth revisiting later now because it means, I'm gonna revisit this later, it means it is slightly more important to an algorithm than a, like, it's a slightly stronger. Weighted metric. So videos that will tend to have high favorites or saves are usually very valuable it's usually content that people might want to reference to beat friends in an argument or stuff that's You know helps people with a project they're working on or is like super interesting information that you might want to call back to you Or something that's a really good inspiration, you know, you might be doing like architectural, um, you know, like Homemaking design and that that would get a lot of saves So it's all it's just thinking what would make people want to come back later And it's generally having some sort of utility or value in the content.

So educational content will get this a lot They're not the strongest thing. You don't need to worry too much about optimizing for these They will just come with good content But what you should know and this this was something that happened very early on in my career is that sometimes You Saves are actually bad if you're getting a lot.

If you're getting a, you know, say you get 200 likes on a video, it's got maybe 2, 000 views, and you've got 200 saves as well, like inordinately high saves, or maybe even over the amount of likes you got.  And it's a very valuable video, but it's very information dense, because it's the sort of stuff I was doing.

Um, the problem is the saves isn't people watch the whole thing and then love it so much, I'm gonna save that again for later. So It's, uh, wow, this is a lot of information, but I think it's important. I'll get back to that, and then people don't. So, saves, being, saves might  tell you that you're being too information heavy.

If, if you're getting lots and lots of them, but the video's still not doing well. It means people are saving it, and then going, alright, but not now. You know? It means you're maybe not being entertaining enough. Maybe you're, you're, you're just being a bit too exclusionary to your audience who are, You know, just trying to relax.

The next one is comments. Comments are actually really, really, really strong. Uh, they're one of the first ones you want to start trying to optimise for because it's quite easy to get them as long as you know what you're doing. People comment for five main reasons. To celebrate, to say, Hey, love this, well done, love your content.

To correct a mistake you made. To clarify something you said but wasn't clear to other people in the comments. Uh, to make a joke either at your expense or at the expense of something you talked about in the video. Uh, And to argue, you know, with other people in the comment section or with you or you know, any of that.

So those are the five main ways you get them. Now you can farm comments, you can make intentional mistakes in your video. Um, in my experience you are going to make accidental mistakes anyway, so just wait for them to happen 'cause they bloody do. Uh, you can be more controversial. You can be disparaging to certain communities, um, I got a lot of comments from Metalheads once, because I said, Metalheads?

Um, you know, and, but it was a hundred comments which boosted me in the algorithm. I pissed off the Wizard of Oz fandom once. Uh, which also got loads of comments from them, boosted me in the algorithm, took the video up probably by a million views. You can just straight up ask people to comment as well, like, you can say things like, Oh, I won't go into this, but someone in the comments will explain, uh, you know, things like that.

And there are other ways by, like, getting your friends to comment, you know, stuff that starts discussions, whether it's very controversial stuff, or Just, just something that incites other people to respond. The reason comments are so powerful to an algorithm is because, uh, when people read the comments, the video continues playing behind it.

And when they type their comments, it's still playing. So, the algorithm sees that as, you know, that's your retention being much higher, but also it sees your video. Is now, say it's a one minute video, but you've got a really active political comment section that people are really just infused with. That video now, to an algorithm, people spend five minutes on.

So, of course, it's going to get pushed. A healthy comment section is also really, really good because sometimes that can be more valuable than the video itself. A lot of people just want to read a discussion. They just want to read the equivalent of like a Reddit thread. And you can. If you, if you have a healthy, strong comment section, you provide that joy as well. 

So it adds a dimensionality to the value people get out of your video. It adds a discussion element which brings people closer to the content, um, but just also makes people stick around for longer, right? The next one is probably the strongest of the, you know, the button metrics, uh, shares. So I've got a lot of thoughts around what's a button.

Shareable, but just the basics a share is you bringing someone into a video. It's you going. Hey, look at this So it's having a video that people want to watch with someone else or show someone else I know that sounds obvious, but I'm just stating what I share  So I'd say there's like three main reasons to get shares, at least that I've seen, and these are the three I at least try to optimise for.

So the first one is taking credit. Now, uh, I think this one is, uh, one that people often forget about, but when you Think when you share a meme to a friend. You're not saying, hey, look at this funny meme some guy made. You're saying, hey, look at this that I found, and I found it funny, and I gave it to you.

Obviously, you're probably not that much of a megalomaniac in your own head, but that is essentially what you're doing in that scenario. So when people share a TikTok video,  they, they kind of want the credit for the contents of that video. They want to be saying, Hey, I have this opinion as well or hey, this is the information that you should know and is my argument if that makes sense.

Also in like funny or nice videos, it's hey, look at this. This is funny, right? But it's, it's, it's just having information people want to take credit for. So that can be things like, uh, controversial political opinions. That can be like surprising facts you'd probably never heard about, which, um, I rag on quite a lot because you can take credit for those surprising facts pretty easily.

But also like things like news like, uh, This has just happened and you show that and it's like have you heard about this? You know, you're getting the credit for showing other people  You know, if you try and, it's hard to, you know, triangulate exactly what that kind of information is to put in your video, but it's, it's something you need to be thinking about.

As I said, shares are super, super important. The other reason people share videos is, um, I call it reminders. So, uh, people will share videos to people that aren't The video reminded them of, if that makes sense. Um, so, you know, people will send me a video that reminds them of a conversation we were having.

You know, maybe I go out to the pub with someone. Uh, we talk about something in the news. We talk about Jojo Siwa. Um, and then next day they sent me a TikTok on that because it's something we were talking about. It's uh, this is more of a bid to general human connection, right? This is um, this is something that's quite pleasant and there can be a lot of different degrees to this.

It can be, this reminds me of a conversation we were having the other day. Or, this reminds me of you in general. You know, maybe it's something about the, some, you know, what that person's interested in. You get some film facts, you share it to your friend who likes film. You get some, um, you get a video on, um, music, you share it to your friend who's, you know, plays guitar.

You, you get a comedy skit about, um, Someone who works in a shop you send it to a friend who works in the shop you go This is you but it is is very powerful to do that ways I would suggest that you go about trying to optimize, you know having your videos remind people of their their friends is One is making a video on a conversation people were probably having at the pub last night.

So, you know stuff like You know conspiracy theories is a good one. Anything in the news is a good one politics is a good one You political opinions, you know, the sort of stuff people will be chatting about when they meet up, you know, shop talk as it was. Try to relate more to the interest side of things.

So, uh, you know, I don't know what your niche is, but like how does it relate to what is a human interest, uh, from a like a vicarious perspective, you know, so like for example, Say you're a bedroom producer and you make like your own synth sounds. You could do a video on how to make synth sounds, but that's not going to get a broad audience.

It's not really shareable. Or you do a more fun video about bedroom producing more broad, and then someone will see that and they'll enjoy it, but it will really remind them of their friend.  Uh, who is a bedroom producer and probably is interested in synth sounds, uh, and that way they share the video to them.

So it's like, how do you be broad about a topic that some people are really niched down on? Um, cause people will share to their friends. You've got to pick the like live, love, laugh of human characteristics as well. You know, um, you know, like the equivalent of like, you like music, so you get a mug that says rock and roll on it from your grandparents for Christmas.

You know, it's that level of.  vaguely relating to an area of hobby based identification. That got to a bit of a ramble, but just to clarify, just, if you speak in certain areas of discourse, it will remind people of themselves or their friends. The last one's a bit similar to the last two, but I think it deserves its own, uh, delineation.

Shared experience. By shared experience, I mean, uh, say something's really scary, and you go, Watch this. Or something's really, really good, and you just have to show someone. Because, basically, when people experience something that's really emotional, really funny, really interesting, Uh, really shocking in any way, uh, there's just that feeling that it feels weird to be the only one who has seen it.

Uh, and then people will go on to forums or they'll go to their friend who's seen it and you have that discussion almost immediately because, you know, you get to the end of something and it feels like, no, I, I want more of that or it just creates this dissonant state, which I, I'm not really qualified to go into, but I'm sure you all know what I mean.

But, uh, so that's another reason people share is what I'm saying. People will share.  based on wanting to share the experience. So, once again, how do you get this? Well, you tell a really shocking fact that, uh, you know, completely spins people out. You know, something about a celebrity no one knew. It'd be nice to say, just make something that's outrageously good and funny, but obviously, we'd all like if we could do that.

I'd say the easiest way to optimize for the shared experience part, and also the reminder part, this is a similar point about both,  Playing on anger and it's not ideal. Obviously you could play on positive emotions, but You know presenting a frustrating but relatable situation is a really good way to To rile people up and then they have to share and go have you seen this?

This is horrible your Facebook mum Karen type demographics, right? But also, you know, you drum up that anger that once again can relate to conversations people were having so then act as a reminder Or you can talk about something frustrating that happened to a friend of yours. So you're telling a story Someone who has a similar or knows someone who has had a similar experience will share it to them and someone who's had a similar experience will share it to their friends and be like, This is what happened to me!

Does that make sense? Um, I've, I do think, although albeit sad, the, the best way to capitalise on sharing, and this is why, uh, politically focused accounts do so well, especially on TikTok that doesn't block political content. It is because it plays on the, the anger and the outrage and the frustration, which basically hits all three of the, the sharing possibilities.

Now, the better you are, the less you have to rely on anger and fear to make your content shareable and good, but we'll get there in due time. Do what you will. I'm just saying what I've noticed, what the information says. But ultimately I've spent this amount of time going over shares because it's really, really important and when you write a script and come up with an idea, you want to be thinking is it shareable?

Because if it's not shareable, you've got really no hope to top the, you know, million and up views sort of area. Your videos shareable. It's probably the most powerful metric. Outside of retention rate which we will get to in a bit now the last of the button metrics by that I mean the ones that you can click on on screen while watching the video is I very rarely hear people talk about this one But I think it's I think it is very important.

Is it conversion to followers now on each app? They're all different but each app has a follow the creator button directly on a video That the, that viewers can press. Now, no one seems to talk about it and how it affects viewership, but I've, I've run tests personally and it absolutely does. If you, it's another thing the algorithm is definitely looking at.

If people are watching a video and then following you from it, it is more likely to push it to more people. Um, I, I tested this because when I, I used to do so when I do call to actions in most video which I'll get to another point in this course. I do call to actions in practically every video. asking for people to follow me if they're enjoying the video.

It's just a nice little reminder. Now, every time I do that in my retention graph always dips. So I thought, maybe I'll get more views if I take that out and I took it out and the retention graph didn't dip. I've got higher retention, but videos I did that with did way worse overall. So clearly followers is an important metric.

So, the question is, then, how do we optimize for that? So, uh, the main way is just ask. Um, just ask your viewers to follow you from the video. Most times, people just forget. Uh, so just simply reminding them will make them, you know, ten times more likely to follow. Uh, I get people in my comments a lot. Stop asking for followers.

It doesn't make a difference. They're completely wrong. It makes roughly a ten times difference the amount of followers a video gets. I would say it's important to, where you place, uh, where you ask. Um, doing it at the end of the video, generally a bit less effective. I think it's important. Because it's a button, they can just tap on screen.

Somewhere in the middle is great. Usually, right before the thing they really, really want. So if you're doing a list, right before the last one. If you're going through information, just sandwich it somewhere in the middle. Before you get to, you know, build to a point. Um, but there's also some more like subtle ways to do it as well.

So I'll give you a few examples of, I wrote down. So these are like turns of phrases to put in your video to get more followers. Just do what you want. Um, these are just some examples.  If you've watched this far, you clearly care about X, so drop me a follow. Nice basic one. If you like this, follow me, because I'm going to show you how to become rich.

You know, or whatever it is you do. If you found this valuable and you want to see more content like this, hit follow. This, this is a good FOMO one. So maybe you put your picture of your follower account on the screen. Let's say it's 10, 000. You say 10, 000 people are already getting value about X every day, so don't miss out.

And another one, this is a good FOMO one. My followers already know about this, but if this is your first video of mine you're seeing and then you go Oh, this is what happened, I do this, and this is what I do, so then you lead into your expertise, but you kind of frame it as like, oh, I need to, I want to get to this information, but I do need to tell you this, when really you don't need to tell them that.

Um, it's just a way to remind people to follow you. It's less direct, but it still works way better than just not telling them. saying it at all. It's also worth noting that follower behavior is different on all platforms. It's much easier to get followers on TikTok because the for you feed is the main feed people watch content on.

So by following more people, it doesn't really negatively affect the viewer in any way. Um, that's also because on TikTok, you're less likely to follow your friends. Your friends probably aren't content creators. Um, so you don't need to catch up with them. When it comes to Instagram, followers are more like gold dust.

People are less likely to follow. Well, They're not less likely to follow. It's just getting followers on Instagram is more like a snowball effect It happens so much slower because most people won't follow until they've seen lots of other people follow you and then they'll go Okay, this guy is clearly valuable.

They need that authority Now this is mainly partly because Instagram is a different demographic to tick tock. It's a bit more older a bit more Anally retentive and a bit more professional. Um, but also because the Instagram feed people use to, uh, keep up with, uh, their friends, people they follow, and they don't want necessarily you in their feed.

Um, I'd say Instagram, it's easier to get people to follow based on, uh, the promise of further value, um, rather than the promise of further entertainment. And those two things are very different, but also very, very similar. Yeah. But, uh, TikTok, you can just say, Hey, I'll give you another cool video. And people will follow up with that.

Well, on Instagram, less so because people want to feel like their feed is curated. It's just something to know as rambling, but it's, you know, it took me about a year to understand that the platforms I've been using. Very minutely different in demographic. Facebook, people will follow anything. Uh, same with YouTube.

It's just Instagram where I find people are actually like quite picky. Besides just asking, there are two other ways to get more followers off a video. One is just by making content that's so good, people go, Fuck, I want that again. Which, uh, I mean, we'd all love to do that all the time. Um, but, uh, That's another thing that gets people followers.

The other thing is, uh, I call them like, follower farming. You know, like, follower farming, you know, fundraiser type thing. Basically, you would have seen these. I did one, uh, with beans, uh, where I said, Day one of eating my followers in beans until I have to eat half a million beans, is what I said. And then the amount of followers I got on each video, I would eat beans.

I only did it for two days because I got really sick and the house was covered in beans after day one. But loads of people, I saw a guy on Instagram who, uh, stealing, stealing my amount of followers worth in dollars. Then he would steal more progressively bigger and bigger things every day. Uh, some people color in like a little square of a picture every day.

Some people do a step for every follower they get, you know, and they'll have to run miles. It worked as well. I, I'd say  I'd recommend doing something like this if you can think of a creative way to do it that people haven't seen before Because it's a great way to get those initial followers which um for most of the platforms, uh, definitely facebook and  TikTok, uh, there is a follower threshold you have to reach to be eligible for monetization.

And if you're looking to monetize your content through ad revenue, then you kind of want to hit that threshold as quick as possible, you know, not, not waste any watch minutes, right? So I'd recommend doing, you know, something like that. I eat a bowl of oats for every follower I get. Yeah. I worked with a few people who are all doing this kind of thing once in like a bootcamp kind of setting.

Yeah.  And I found the ones that work best of those, if you do want to make one of those, is the ones where there's a one to one direct relationship with the viewer and the thing you do. Like, one follower equals one bean. You know, people can actually see The relationship between them hitting follow and the, uh, the change in the physical world, uh, they're, they're more likely to follow.

Uh, but yeah, those are the, those are the three ways you get follows. It's, it's fairly simple, but it's worth thinking about. Okay, so finally, we're gonna go over the, the most important one. I'm sorry I fucked you about for this long. The most important one, your retention rate, uh, the retention graph, your average watch time, and your completed view rate, which are all the same thing.

Um,  and they're all really, really important. Uh, so I'm gonna go over how to read them. Now, the retention graph, you're probably familiar with. If you're not, you can find it in the analytics or insights section to any video. Um, and it's a blue line like this one. This is the one on TikTok. Um, I hate how long it is.

It really doesn't give you a lot of information.  Let's go for the one on Instagram instead. So on Instagram you have to go to the feed feed for some reason. And then you have to go to insights, there you go. You're smart enough to figure that out, but Anyway, so here we go. Yeah, this this will tell us the same amount of information.

So we've got a retention graph We can look here and track how much of our audience is staying over this amount of time, right? So we've got so it's basically a line and you'll see uh on the left side. We've got the percentages That's the percentage of your total viewers that are watching the video and along the bottom.

You've got the duration of the video so At 15 seconds, 74 percent of the views on this video were still watching. A minute and a half, uh, 57 percent of people were still watching. That's really high. That's really good. We like that. And once again, I, uh, went over it in the last lesson, but right about here is when I ask people if they're enjoying, please follow, and you see that tiny little dip where we go from 61  To 58 where we lose 3 percent in just a few seconds.

So reading your retention graph, uh, basically just like I did there Look for any obvious dips or slopes All of them will slope down over time because people will always tune out if they slope if it's really steep slope Then yeah, your video is boring. Your video is not really living up to your hook There's a lot of different ways a retention curve can look and by the shape you can sort of tell whether or not What you're doing, right what you're doing wrong Regardless, there's a lot of different shapes for a retention graph, um, but it's a great tool to diagnose when people are watching.

What their behavior is. Is the hook working, or is the whole thing pants, or when do I start getting boring? It's really good to look at things like that. And it's also the thing that the algorithm is optimizing for. A good retention is the thing algorithms are saying Fuck yeah to. Because it's literally the amount of time people are spending on the platform.

Because of that, there's like two other things we can look at, um, back on TikTok, which is the average watch time. So this is just the, the average viewer coming onto your video, is watching for this amount of time. I'd say, if your average watch time's lower than like 27 seconds  Um, unless you've got a 27 second video, uh, that's bad.

Your, your average watch time should be really high, because at the end of the day, an algorithm is just looking for people to stay on their platform for as long as possible. And if they've got a video, your video, that they can suggest to people, and know they've got people for at least another 41 seconds, in the case of this video, the algorithm's gonna really like that.

So how do you get average watch time up? Well, Well, if you think about it, if you remember what an average is, it's just taking all the values that every, you know, taking the amount of time everyone stays on the video for and dividing it by the amount of viewers. So if we think about that, um, an average watch time is always going to be lower because every single retention graph starts with this spike at the, at the top of it.

Your average watch time is always going to be brought down. So if we want to increase our average watch time, we want to increase that minimum amount of time people stay along for. Now, this is where I'm going to sound like I'm getting a bit close to clickbait, and that's because I am. Uh, sometimes you need to do a bit of clickbait.

As long as you back it up with some good shit, you're fine. If you have a start of a video that, for some reason, necessitates people stay for at least 10 seconds, instead of the 3 seconds everyone gives a video, your average view time is gonna be that 7 seconds up. So, a good way to bump average watch time, is to actually work on that first 10 to 20 seconds of your video.

Find a way to lock people in, um, so then that bumps the whole average. And even if your video gets really shit at the end, you've still got a high average watch time, which is keeping people on. I hope that made sense. Uh, to give you an example, one way I kept average watch time up When, um, I had to make loads and loads of videos a week, and a lot of them would just be lazy, um, would be reaction videos.

Um, I'll go, I'll go, I'll go over this later in the course, but a reaction video is just where you get a video, um, you know, put it in the corner of someone else, uh, saying a bad take, and then reacting to it. You know, it can be a good take, but that's less interesting.  Stitches do this as well. Um, basically, if you've got a video with such a bad take, people are gonna see it, and because they know, because you've either got Stitch incoming, or, you know, they can tell from the framing that you're gonna react,  They're gonna at least wait for what you have to say because they're like, well, let's see, let's at least see what this other guy says, uh, then I'll scroll away.

So reaction videos are a really good way to basically lock in an audience for  extra time really early. And there's lots of other hacks you can do. Just have a more exciting hook where loads of stuff is happening. Have a really confusing opening. Have some slime content. Uh, all these things will, uh, up your, you know, those, those, you know, that 50 percent that are going to stop viewing immediately, no matter what, those are things that will keep them around for another, even five seconds, the amount of average watch time you want, um, to, to get your video, you know, push to make it go viral.

It's different in each platform, but generally I'd say, as I said earlier, around 28 seconds or more. Uh, and then you have a chance of getting a million views. Uh, the higher it is, the better. Not necessarily, it's not a one to one linear, more average watch time equals more views. But, you do want a high average watch time.

So, the, the next thing and the, the last main thing is the, uh, the completed view rate. And you'll see on this video it's 31, 32 percent. Uh, that's also very high. Now this one, I can't quite tell if it matters. I've seen evidence that it's good, I've also seen evidence that it doesn't really matter. Um, I think it really ultimately boils down to the length of your video.

If you've got a 4 minute video, but only 2 percent of people stay, you know, watch the full video,  but you've got an average watch time of like a, you know, a minute and a half, The algorithm is still going to send that to everyone because it doesn't matter about the blind spot towards the end You'll still, the average view is still staying for a really long time.

So I don't think it matters on long videos I think where it starts to matter is short videos because I know the algorithm wants to show people Content that will have them on a video for the longest possible amount of time. I know that that's just completely true I think with the if you've got a shorter video if you're doing a 20 second video or a 30 second video Then the percentage of completed views You have is going to be a lot more important in whether or not your video gets pushed because if you think about it Even if you've got like a short video if you've got a high completed view rate That means at least 80% Everyone's watching as much of your video as they possibly can which still looks good to an algorithm because it kind of suggests Well, if you did make a minute long video you'd you'd be flying generally I don't think it matters loads average watch times a lot more important And I tend to only make longer videos because you can monetize them I personally think very truly believe well, I can't fully back it up  All the algorithms just prefer the longer videos because they keep people on their platforms for longer.

Okay, so that's completed view rate done. The last thing, finally, is, um, just the, the other metrics. Uh, the, these can be important, um, it's really good to know. Uh, so, uh, your gender demographics, uh, something like this, two thirds to a third split is, uh, is fine. So then, age is important because that's, uh, that's really gonna be like the sort of stuff you talk about.

Um, this particular video, I don't know why, usually, uh, 18 34 is my key demographic. 45 and up is, is really strong. Um, but what's cool about this video, is it's very clearly appealing to everyone. Which means, um, if I go and put it on Facebook, which I'm gonna do later, it's, it's gonna do really well. That might have sounded weird, uh, everyone on Facebook is old.

Just to clear things up. So it's just good to know these things. If I had a very old demographic, but I was saying like Riz and Gyat and, uh,  and Skibbity Toilet, um, I'd get significantly more views if I stopped saying those things and, you know, started huffing lead paint or something. Whatever old people do.

Then probably the most important one is your location. It's good to know where most of your viewership are. I have about 50 50 U. S. and U. K. And then, um, the Great Nation of Other is 8 percent of my viewership and then the rest are all negligible. This is good because it lets me know the, uh, first of all, when to post.

Um, posting time basically doesn't really matter. Um, but you do want to post when, uh, your audience is awake and relaxed. So you, uh, I tend to post in the early evening when people are just getting home from work. But if I, uh, Had even more of a States audience I would post in the US evening where people are just getting home from work But I definitely wouldn't post in those few hours when everyone in the UK and the US is asleep So that informs those sorts of decisions.

Also if you plan to monetize your content, you do want those first world developed nation audiences because they  They're worth the most, sad to say. So with that, I think we've now done every single metric you could possibly want. I know YouTube has extra metrics in the, the Browse vs. Search vs. External and  that's beyond the scope of our interest right now.

It's gonna make negligible difference to know about that. Um, that's every metric. Uh, that's how important each one is. Uh, how to optimize for each one, which we went over. And, uh, what they are telling you that you are doing or need to be doing. This has been great,  uh, I'll see you in the, the next lesson then.

 Hello, my lovely students. Um, this video is going to be on how to come up with viral ideas, how to then research. Uh, for those ideas and basically everything you want to be doing before the, you know, the scripting phase, right? So you learn the last one, what each metric means and sort of what stuff you want to optimize for to, to go viral.

But now we need to figure out, you know, what our idea is, what our, our viral big hitter is going to be. Because at the end of the day, that's going to be the biggest decision we make on any video is the, the idea. The, the topic that you choose informs everything, you know, sometimes just a good topic will get you comments, will get you shares. 

So, how do we go about doing this? Um, of course, there's lots of ways. You can read magazines, you can go into archives, if you're doing some history stuff. You can, you know, stay up to date with the news, if you're doing more news stuff. Or if you're a comedy account, you can, uh, you know, come up with jokes.

However, you know, whatever your artistic process is there. But I'm now talking to those people who are watching this, who are looking to do this, Um, for clients, uh, maybe not just themselves. And if that's you, you might at one point have three or four clients a week, each one you're making seven TikToks for.

And you're going to need a way to very easily find ideas that aren't dog shit and awful. So this, this section is going to be on how to find ideas the, the smart way, or the easy way, or the process way. This section is for if you're struggling to come up with ideas, how to do the How to get the lazy idea.

Generally, I think you should still, like, have videos you spend a lot of time on. But, naturally, especially if you work with clients, you're going to have a lot of videos where you just need them to have a chance at going viral, but you've got, like, no time to script and no time to research. I'm gonna split this one into, like, two main sections.

We're gonna look at trends, and we're gonna look at pre validated content. First, we've got trends, or trend jacking, or, uh, you know, current affairs. So how do we track trends, and how do we hop on trends to make sure our videos are gonna go viral? How do we find what to make the videos about? So there's sort of two halves to finding a video topic, um, off of a trend.

Uh, the first half is Finding the, the area, finding the discourse that you want to make your video about. So, to do this, it's, uh, sort of two things you can do. Uh, number one is like, go to the front page of YouTube, uh, front page of Reddit, Uh, go on your TikTok and Instagram feed, look at what's, uh, going viral.

You know, if you're noticing something in a specific area on, on YouTube or, or on the front page of Reddit, That's a good thing. It's like, okay, that's what I'm going to stick my video in. Say people are talking about a certain celebrity or a certain movie or, um, you know, a, a new tech product, whatever it is, that's what you want to make your video on.

And this is the thing we're going to signpost at the start of our video. That's the, let's say that's the topic. Now the other half of a trend jacking is the specifics. So we've got the topic. But what's the specifics? What's the meat of the video? Now, this is the thing that has to be new. Um, trends, people like them because it's new.

And if they see a video that is, uh, on a trend, they, they want to know new things about that trend, right? I hope you're following this. So let's say you saw a video of a particular celebrity. Maybe Elon Musk said some nuts thing and everyone's talking about him again. On every platform and you've decided the topic is Elon Musk.

He's trending. Okay. What's the specifics? Well, you can't say what the other videos said because they've already said it I mean you can it might work, but let's not go there What you want to do is you want to go on google search in this case Elon Musk and find Uh, a niche piece of data about the thing that's trending.

There you go, that's your specifics. And then when it comes to presenting that video, you up front go, The situation with Elon Musk is so much worse. And people go, Oh, I'm interested in that, because that's what's happening right now. And then you hit them with the specifics, and hopefully it's new information that people haven't heard of before, because it's, you know, it was ten minutes ago.

And now you've got a viral video there. Very, very easy. Further, uh, some people, uh, uh, twist this. They go, here's the thing that's happening with Elon Musk, and, you know, that, that's the hook, people are interested. And then you can find really old stuff about that, and then, you know, through clever scripting, talk about that.

So you'd be like, well, he said this, but you know what? He actually said the same thing 15 years ago. And people go, even though it's not new news, it's, it's new information, On the trending topic. There was a bit of a word salad Um, but I think that should be clear you want a topic people recognize Um because that serves as the hook then you want specifics they've not heard before and this can be either something that's really really new or you can do some digging around it and Find a way to twist it into the current situation.

Yes, that is yellow page journalism, but um This is social media, and this is how it works. Another way to find, like, good topics, uh, Google Trends, uh, You can, you can search through certain words, see if they're trending. Like, Google Trends is pretty good to see what people are searching for. Other platforms are like Twitter.

Twitter's actually a good place, even though it's mostly non video, although it is changing, because you have the, the trending hashtag sections, and you have the discover section on, on Twitter. That's also good because it tells you what people are talking about. And sometimes, before things And most of the time, before something's got to, uh, the video platforms, it's usually started, uh, on a written platform, like Twitter.

We'll come back to Twitter because it pertains more to the next section, which is pre validated content. The other half of trends is, like, not necessarily something that's trending, but is current affairs. People still want news, even if, um, it's not something that's trending. As long as it's new and interesting, people want to hear it.

A good way to get that kind of stuff is follow a newsletter or a magazine. Or, you know, read the paper, just read the news, um, you know, keep refreshing till you get a story you like. And then, there you go, that's your video. Even better if it's like, related to something that's trending, but even not. Just finding something in the news, related to your niche, is a great way to get an easy video.

The other easy method to like, finding a good video idea, is to  Pre validated content now it should be clear from the the term what that means but very quickly to go over it It's just stuff that's worked before you may have also heard of like evergreen topics Which just means stuff that people always want to hear about although that's that's kind of similar But evergreen topics will be more broad Pre validated content is is much narrower finding pre validated content is just finding a post that's gone viral and You and making a video on the same thing.

Because if it's gone viral on one platform, it just shows it's very interesting to people. If you work for clients, uh, it's very good to do pre validated content. Most clients, when you pitch them an idea, want to hear why, why that's something that's gonna go viral. So it's good to be like, oh, that will go viral because this thing I found will go viral.

So it's also good for client work. It's also worth saying, quickly, that it's not stealing. There is a big difference between Pre validated content and stealing. Stealing is, uh, ripping off someone's idea, uh, and if it's a post that's got lots of independent research, taking their research for yourself, um, and not crediting the original author.

Pre validated content is seeing a post that's done well, on a specific topic, and making a video on that topic. And how much you overlap your posts is up to you, and how good you feel about yourself, and how much time you have. This lets you know without trial and error that the video you're going to make is very likely So, how do we find pre validated content?

Well, the number one easiest place to see what people are talking about, what sort of conversations get the most outrage, what sort of posts or ideas or anything people are listening to is Reddit. If you're making content within a specific niche, Uh, join every single subreddit related to that niche and every time you look for videos go through, you know, the top this week or top this month posts and see if there's like something that's connecting them or just do videos on that same idea or if they're referencing articles or news just, you know, do a video on that.

Reddit is just a great way to find pre validated content. Another one that I like to use and, uh, something not a lot of people use is popular videos in other niches. So if you're seeing, uh, you know, when you're having your leisure scroll certain type of content or topic that's doing really well, but people like not in your niche or people who make videos that aren't really similar at all to yours, if you're noticing a pattern or if something just goes really viral for someone, Figure out how you take whatever they did different and put it in your content, because it's pre validated.

The same goes for people in your niche. If anyone in your niche has a sudden viral hit, then look at what they did that video on and try to, uh, replicate it. Speak in the same space, because it's clearly something that works. Another really strong way to get pre validated content is just look at your past videos.

Find a video that did really well. Once you start getting viral videos, look at your own content. Be liked. I've been posting then I had this one that did a million and then everything else just is still a you know a few thousand What? Remake the million one even almost word for word if you have to you know, that's the lazy content I did do that again You can sometimes get red herrings very very rarely videos will just go viral for no discernible reason And you'll try and replicate it, and it never works.

If you're doing that, after a certain amount of time, just give up. It was a complete red herring, it was a unicorn video. But don't be afraid to make videos you've pretty much made before. Don't be like, oh, I already did a video on that. There's only like, so many topics. And people's attention span and their memory capacity on these social media platforms is very, very thin and very, very small.

So if you almost word for word remake a video, there's a good chance it will go viral again. Also, if you think, say the first one went viral and you consider viral to be 100, 000 views, that's good for you. Um, if you make it again, Uh, and it goes to 100, 000 people again. It will probably go to 100, 000 different people.

So no one will even notice you've basically remade the same video. So for quick ideas, go digging. Another one is Twitter. Most good pieces of content have just started on Twitter or Reddit for some reason. Look at the conversations people are having, look at what's trending, and just let that be your guide in what to make a video on.

So just to close, This section has been on how to find ideas the, the lazy way. For those of you that have to make loads and loads and loads and loads of videos. I'd say once you become more established and you can make better content, it's good to mix those with, um, your natural creative flair, as it were.

You always want to find those topics. Um, and you want to, you always want to find good topics. You know, you want to know you're speaking in an area people will listen to.  Once, once you start getting better, um, start, you know, being creative with how you present it, start being creative with like, you know, the specifics, you know, wax poetic.

As you develop as a creator, you should, you know, develop as an artist. But when starting out, um, it's a great way to do this, you know, follow Follow the rules because then you'll start getting the viral hits people will start liking that account and you'll start getting a real feel For like what does better and what doesn't and and you know after a couple years you get to like my point where you know Before you've even made a video Whether it'll get, you know, two million views or a hundred K But sticking to those rules really specifically is only gonna be for like beginners And it's only gonna be for like people in a pinch but in some you should have an understanding for how to find the topics people are looking at and Also how to like make sure what you're presenting is still fresh.

Thank you very much. I'll see you in the next one

 Should you niche down and if you niche down, should it be broad or should that be very narrow? This is kind of a question that infects a lot of the, um, you know, the social growth community. There's a lot of like, uh, conflicting views on this and by that I mean, uh, pretty much all of them seem to say No, have a narrow niche, really niche down, and I completely disagree.

Uh, I don't think that at all works with how social media works these days. Now, if you don't know what I mean at all, then, uh, I'm sorry. Uh, a niche is basically just an area of interest that you're likely to  about. So, so, so your niche might be like gardening, it might be art, um,  it might be video games, it might be TV, movies, you know, horror stuff.

It can be anything, uh, celebrity gossip, property, entrepreneurship. There's a lot of different niches and some niches are very big, like. Celebrity gossip, and some are very small, like neurobiology. And the question is really, should you niche down? There's a sort of schism, I would say, on how much you should niche down.

So, up foremost, you, your content should have, like, a thing. You should always be, like, the guy who does that thing. Uh, some influence are just straight up, like, I'm hot and young and that's their thing, but it's still a thing, you know, they're, they're a lifestyle influencer or they're travel influencer, everyone has a thing.

So in that sense, you should niche down. The reason to do this is because people want to follow you and they're only going to follow you if you keep making content they like. So you should pick a niche, absolutely. If you just make a completely different thing every video.  appealing to anyone. A lot of people follow based on  their self identity. 

You want to appeal to that. Another reason to niche down, a lot of you and a lot of people starting out like a social media or a TikTok channel are likely to have business goals with that. Yes, you can monetize through the platforms and you can get sponsorships, but some of you might have a, you know, a service or a product you're trying to sell.

And if that is the case, um, the thinking there is say you've got a physical product that's like, um, an herbal remedy then you should make content specifically about herbal remedies and green treatment and you know, whatever's going on there. Because you're going to end up with followers who are very likely customers.

Now that's generally the view on why you should have quite a narrow niche. And this, this belief seems to come, uh, as my understanding of it, from an older generation of like millennial people. Social media marketeers. I've worked with these people and I understand why they think that their thinking is, you know, before algorithms were so intense People would find things based on their interest and and follow those sort of topics.

The key way back then, you know 15 20 years ago that someone would end up following a creator Um, I think that term was less used. Would be by search. You would search like, I'm interested in this thing, how to do this thing, how to, how to, you would search something pertaining to your niche. And then you would get recommended some videos or some articles and then you'd go I really like that and then you'd, you'd follow and then you'd, you'd actively keep seeking it out.

You wouldn't even always be just presented to you like the, the feed we have now. And in that world, when that was how you got discovered, it was, it's very, very good to, to niche all the way down, be hyper niche, you know. If you know anything about SEO, you know, you want those long tail SEOs. You want to rank for every keyword relating to just your niche.

So you, you really want to be like the specialist on that. So there is a lot of thought and thinking, and also all of your fans are very likely to buy your product or service. If you've niched right down, you've got the best audience of like high converting  that are likely to buy from you, right? So the thinking is solid, and I can't say for sure, personally, whether one approach is right or the other.

I can only give you what I've learnt from my experience. And in my experience, as someone who started their career During, you know, the current era of social media and, um, you know, algorithmically recommended content. That the, that way of hyper niching down is just gonna shoot yourself in the foot. Or, even if it works, you're committing yourself to really slow growth.

This is something I've argued with, with clients I've had, um, you know, who might be, you know, just ten years older than me. Um, but because so much changed in that time, there is a difference of understanding that. But to my belief, that thinking of really niching down Is to, to rank for search. To make yourself be easy to be found by search and search alone.

Because that's the way we used to find things. But now, um, you want to rank for, you know, let's call it browse. Or the for you page, or the feed, right? And ranking for browse is algorithmically dictated. And how do algorithms decide how to push out your videos? Um, they push them out based on the current performance.

Um, if your video is doing well in browse, or the for you page, or the feed, then it's going to get pushed even more in the for you page, or the thing, or the feed. You know, if it's doing well in search, it's going to get pushed more in search. But the problem is, the feed kind of goes to everyone. And early on especially, but generally all the time, The first 200, 1, 000, 2, 000 people the algorithm sends your content to are ultimately going to dictate how much further the algorithm sends it.

In a video that's ultra niche, hyper niche, it's like, here's how to change the pressure valve on an office chair when you only have it before. That coming up on almost everyone's feed is going to get swiped on and then that video is not going to get pushed further. Yes, if people search that, they're going to get that video.

But that's not the main way people are find finding content. Sorry to keep going over the point, but I think it's important. Now, if you want your video to get seen and seen by lots and lots and lots of people, you do need to play the game of the For You page or the search. So in that sense, really niching down and making your content Only enjoyable to the customers you want to have, unless you have a broad customer base.

That's, that's not good. It's, it's gonna constrict your growth. And the, the problem there is, um, it's gonna constrict your ability to be seen by the people that might actually be interested in your, uh, content or your product or your niche. Say you make super niche content, and the first 200 people it gets sent to, maybe one of them's interested.

Um, and they watch the whole thing, and they even comment, and they like, and they save, and they do everything. But that's still 1 out of 5 percent to the algorithm. Even though it hit that right person, that's, that's very, very little. And now that video is gonna stay there. It's, it's not gonna grow anymore.

Whereas if you made a video that was broadly appealing, but still had, you know, something under the surface, that linked to, you know, what, what actually you're about, the actual niche, you know, people are gonna watch way more of the video, interact with it more, because it's more broadly appealing, and it's gonna get sent to you.

You know, let's say 200, 000 people, and now that 0. 5 percent of people that were interested, instead of being one person, is, uh, 1, 000 people. You see, like, in the way things work now, you want to shoot for broad, because that's how people discover content. Okay, so that's my rant on how much you should niche down.

Another thing I'd say about picking a niche,  Niches aren't just all individual circles, um, niches can be big, they could be small, like I said earlier. And also you can have niches within niches, right? In the niche of workplace culture is the niche of entrepreneurship, inside that is the niche of dropshipping, and inside that would be like the niche of making landing pages.

I don't know. But let's say you have a landing page in Making business just to go off of that example, right? Let's say the thinnest niche you can target is the people interested in how landing pages are made You see the issue with making videos about that Even though that's something you're really good at and you have a good product on that Right, so then where do we draw the line on the content is the thing you really want to be thinking about.

Let's go to that outer niche of, uh, you know, dropshipping or e commerce. Yeah, that's a circle. So that's the bigger niche, e commerce. That's still very specific, but there are a lot of people in that. And then there's also sort of like who you target within that. Is it people already in e commerce? Or if you're making landing pages, maybe you want to target aspirational people.

So then you think, okay, do I just target, you know, what's the bigger niche there? Yeah. Is it, you know, young, young people, specifically young men who've watched too much Andrew Tate and want to become, um, you know, super online entrepreneurs? Because then that's a much larger group of people. You appeal to them and then you, you package the thing you make as like the, this is step one of starting a business or a company.

So that's your mega niche, but then there's problems with that because it's very far removed from your your product Okay, maybe we don't like that niche. Then do we go for entrepreneurship? Or then do we go for like maybe cut the econ thing? Do we go for design? You know, there's always a broader niche whatever niche you're in are you in property?

Could you be about entrepreneurship or property could be about like a You can talk on political issues. You know, that's a highly politicized thing, being a homeowner. Your core offering, or your core whatever, the thing you're trying to get across, is going to be a niche of a niche of a niche of a niche.

And you want to pick, basically, what's the broadest amount of people that is still going to contain people, contain enough customers that will buy from you, that you can target. My take on all of this is go as broad as possible.  Um, and then figure it out later. For example, my specialty, and I have this one offering on how to do social media, but then there are so many people on social media that are just complete charlatan snake oil salesmen that haven't actually done it.

So, that's actually not even a good niche to be in, because you just look like a liar. Um, when I made videos in that, people would be like this sucks because it does, no one, it's not that interesting to hear how to grow big on TikTok, especially from someone who's not big on TikTok. So then I thought, okay, I'll just go as broad as possible.

What's something I can think of that will do really well? And then I've stumbled on my current content and occasionally I'll make videos about Creating, uh, TikTok videos. But they'll still be very broad. It'll be more like features of TikTok videos that are tricking you into watching for longer. Instead of, here's how you make it increase your attention.

You see, it's all about gaming the audience. And because I've done that, I now get, you know, when I put out a video, I'll get 10, views for free. That's my starting pool of a video, because I have a very engaged audience.  So even if I just stuck out a pure, very niched down ad, maybe for this course, my video is still getting pushed way further than it would have if I had niched right down from the start.

And even if that does work slowly over time because you rank in search and You know, maybe you get one little, you know, 15k view every now and then. It's still going to be years slower than just going for super, super, super viral, and then maybe reeling it back, making it a bit more related to your content, pivoting, but still keeping a broad audience.

I hope that made sense. The other benefits of going broad is you can make a nice amount of money from, uh, ad revenue. Um, you can, you know, You know, uh, do things like sponsorships as well. But you, you, you set yourself up to have more income streams. Um, you just really want to be smart about it. Um, how you, you know, what broad audience you target and then how you earwig the, the niche audience inside of it.

How do you keep both interested at the same time and still communicate to the ultra niche audience? So those are my thoughts on niching down that's based in all of my experience. I know for a fact having content with very, very niche appeal grows much slower or not at all. One more thing I'd just like to mention is I don't want you to confuse niche with, you know, unique quality. 

Whatever you do, if you're an artist and you're trying to, you know, whether you're trying to sell things or not, whatever you do, you want it to be entertaining. Thank you.  And if there's a way you can get what you do, maybe you're a carpenter, and you can make videos that make it entertaining to anyone who is You know, anyone who likes cool videos is the broadest niche.

Um, that's fine as well. This course is mostly interested with making videos to the broadest possible niche. Um, you can make while still, while still seeming, you know, unique and also being slightly related to the things you're interested in or the things you sell. Other creators do think very different.

I think they're wrong. Get as many views as possible. Get people liking you as a person. And then pivot a little bit and people will still want to buy from you because they like you

 So we're going to talk about hooks. I've got quite a lot to say on hooks, and I think a lot of the, um, the understanding around them in general is, is, is wrong or misguided. They're not something that can be templated, and they're not that complex. I think most people overcomplicate hooks. But we'll get to everything about hooks in this video.

I just wanted to go over basically the, the history of hooks. I think it's important to understand that they're not new. Uh, Hooks have existed for as long as people have been able to speak. And, in fact, probably a bit longer than that. Hooks have been in every single piece of media of all time. And the problem is, if we think about Hooks as something new or modern, then that kind of blinds us to, um, other areas we can draw inspiration from.

Um, if that makes sense. Uh, you know, there's all a hook is, is directing the attention of another human being To the thing you want them to look at or, you know, pay attention to. Basically, a hook is a vehicle through which you can manipulate intrigue. You're gonna get hooks in on the on the front cover of books.

Um, you're gonna get them in TV ads, uh, TV promos, uh, film trailers, film posters, billboards, uh, just basically big hooks, uh, newspaper article headlines.  And, uh, even, uh, philosophical essays and, and, and research papers are gonna have hooks. All it is, is making sure that the first thing everyone sees is Intriguing, captivating, grabs attention.

It's because there's an awash of media. People are making media all the time. Right now, it's social media, uh, and, and content. But before, when people actually read books, books were just fucking coming out. Uh, I remember when I was growing up, we, uh, you know, the Nintendo Wii was the big thing. And, uh, you'd go down to game, and, uh, And there was literally thousands of Wii games just, uh, made in an afternoon, and they'd be like 30 quid.

There's, whenever, uh, people are paying attention to a platform, whether a video game platform, or a certain, uh, newspaper, or people are reading books, Um, the creators of that media have always had to figure out,  Many of you probably don't look at bookshelves that often, but just humor me for a second. If you're looking to buy a book, you're gonna buy the one with the most interesting title, right?

And if you were looking to watch a film, you're gonna go to see the one that had the really captivating trailer. Or, a really good poster. And when you're browsing through the newspaper, or, you know, the news app, the article you read is gonna be the one with the  Having a hook is important. You should think about that first, you know, three, five seconds of your video because it is where people determine whether or not they're going to keep watching. 

Without a hook, your content basically doesn't exist. There's a good quote that illustrates this by the father of advertising, a man, a British man named David Ogilvie, that really puts this into words well. It's worth remembering this because it's important, but he said, On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy.

When you've written your headline, you've spent 80 cents out of your dollar. And this is, uh, completely accurate for, you know, organic social media content. Almost down to the exact, you know, 80 20 percentage. If you didn't understand the quote, basically what Ogilvy was saying is that your hook is the only thing that everyone sees.

People are gonna look at it no matter what, and all you have to do with it is interest them enough to read the rest. So when thinking about hooks for our viral videos, we just want to think about them as something through which we can spark intrigue and promise satisfaction for those who continue watching.

Everything you do on social media, Has to be interesting. This is non negotiable. This is imperative. If you want to be an educator, this is especially interesting because people, you know, in their passive scrolling state aren't really looking to learn. So you will need to find a way to, especially in the hook, package what you're doing in a, in an entertaining and exciting way.

There's actually another good quote by David Ogilvie, which puts this really well, which is you, you cannot bore people into buying your product You can only interest them in buying your product. With that said, um, we're gonna move on to the fundamentals of how to, you know, how to have a good hook. So, a good hook is simple, it's natural, and it's intriguing, right?

It, it, it makes promises and it, it provokes thought, but without revealing the truth. In this section, I'm going to go over the main building blocks of a good hook. Because hooks aren't interchangeable scripts. You can't just take out a word in a thing. And um, you know, put your topic in that template and somehow end up with a, with a hook that people care about.

A hook is whatever works best with your script. It's whatever people are interested in hearing about. A hook is gonna be four main things. So I'm gonna, I'm gonna talk through those main things. Although, a lot of them sort of overlap. And you'll, you'll realize that because there's no, there's no rules, you know.

A hook is A hook is just the first time you make your audience want to keep watching. But your video is going to have multiple hooks throughout, which we'll get to later. So anyway, the first and probably most important thing your hook needs to be is, uh, intriguing, right? That, that makes sense. Being intriguing, uh, you know, is, you know, make a statement or a question.

It's something that, that draws the people in, right? It's something that makes people go, Wait, I don't Is that right? Or what's going on there? It's, it's like mysterious, but it's also exciting, right? I think this is something a lot of creators, uh, get wrong. Um, they, they seem to really misunderstand what intrigue is.

There's a lot of problems I see in, like, amateur hooks that are trying to be intriguing. Um, a lot of them are generally trying to, like, question something, because they've heard it's, like, mystery. Like, for example, they say something like, How did Tupperware become so popular?  But it's like, just, just asking the question in of itself isn't interesting, the topic is more important, you know?

And if the topic's  Even if your hook flops, that's, that's fine. A lot of ones, and I, I did this as well earlier on in my career. A lot of, uh, hooks I see, um, just think saying something, like, random is intrigue. A good example would be like, If you want to stop being poor, then you need to know about the, the frog day effect.

Or something like, have you heard of the radish experiment? Like both of those aren't just like it's not just intriguing to say something I've not fucking heard of right like just because I don't know what that is You haven't given me a reason to be like excited about it And I'm not gonna watch a video to figure out I think there's I you haven't created the intrigue You've just confused me.

You just said you don't know about this. No, I don't  Why is, why is that? Why, why is that interesting? You know, you, you need to explain why that's interesting. You need to say something like, 15 rats drowned in this experiment and that, and that's why we now have the, the, you know, the plastic bag effect. You know, like intrigue is created by details.

It's knowing more shows you how little you know. The other one I sort of see people do is just, Saying something, uh, controversial, because they've heard that will, like, shock people, um, you know, uh, people are intrigued because they want to either hear the point or, you know, they want to see how stupid you are.

But the people that do that aren't actually willing to make an actually controversial statement. So they'll say something like, Oh, I don't think people should work from home every day. It's like, what? What? Like, they've seen someone go, they've seen Andrew Tate say things like, Women should burn and die.

And they're like, oh. I've got a few hot takes that the boys That the boys from the office will like. You know, none of these things are enough on their own. They're not sensational. To be intriguing, you need to basically give the core of the video away as soon as possible. As I said, more information is intriguing because it shows you how much you want to find out.

For example, imagine a headline that says, Man in Dallas, Texas just got decapitated while trying to groom his dog. See, you know all the details, but you're still like, What?  Um, whereas an amateur hook writer is gonna write something like You won't believe what happened to this man when he was grooming his dog.

You want all the details in your hook. And a good hook, you can just present all the details to a crazy story. You know, it's basically just a list of nouns. And people will still watch if there's gaps to fill in. Being intriguing isn't like being mysterious, it's Through making big, bold statements, you know, very sensationalized and then slowly filling in the gaps throughout your video.

Another big pitfall is just, uh, trying to sound like you're sounding too clickbait, you know, they're like, Number four will shock you, and like the, Watch until the end for a huge surprise, like, everyone knows what you're doing. That doesn't work at all. So another thing a hook does, and this is related to intriguing, is plants questions in a viewer's mind.

When they hear your hook, you want them to think, several different questions. You know, this has happened. You want them to think how, or like, I did this without a this. They want to think, how did you do that? And then they might also think, wait, what is that? You know, and then they'll think, you know, why are you doing that?

That you want all those questions just, as, just from the hook. You want as many gaps that the audience wants to fill in as possible. This is backed up by a psychological principle, um, called the Zeigarnik effect. Um, which is basically that, um, the idea that people remember uncompleted, interrupted tasks.

Better than completed ones. Basically, there's more brain activity happening when people don't have all the answers than when they do. And people naturally, uh, you know, they're like, they're like radioactive. They want to get to, uh, they want to get to a stable state. They want all the answers as soon as possible.

So you can implant questions in your viewer's mind either by, uh, you know, explicitly asking questions. Like, how did this man earn a million dollars with a toothbrush? Or, you know, uh, more, uh, Implicitly plant the question in the viewer, you know, I hope that's like I've just done the most embarrassing thing Everyone's like well, what's what's the most embarrassing thing?

The next thing is clarity Clarity is so so important. It needs to be clear what the fuck you're on about Um, Clarity is, is, is crucial. And especially in short form videos where people are like half awake watching that, and, you know, they might be in all sorts of states, um, and they might just be of low intelligence or a child, they need to understand it.

Your hook should be a statement that is just very clearly saying what's going on in the video. What is this video about? And ideally doing that in as few as possible. Words and as simple words as possible, you know, the topic of your video in those first five seconds Should be understood by a drunk man falling asleep and a child with ADHD Alike, you know and this I said this in intrigue But it's important viewers need to know exactly what they're watching if they don't like the terms of the deal They're not going to accept and continue watching the video.

But yeah, you just want to be clear You want to make it really clear what's going on as an example something like you're making eggs all wrong You  It's wasting time, because it's like, you know, what's the viewer gonna think? They're gonna think, no I'm not,  mmm, shut up. Where, where you could have something like, This is how I make eggs, because it makes me less likely to get cancer.

You know, something like that.  Just off the top of my head. Um, but that's, that's all the details. Kind of, but it's, it's like, intriguing, right? Also, just in general, like those negative hooks. You're doing this wrong. Stop doing this. Steal this. I don't, I don't think, like, I know it works, because fear motivates.

But,  I don't know, as someone who doesn't like having orders barked at me, those things immediately turn me away. And I can't imagine they get to me.  Stop doing this. Shut up. Like, well, you know, that's, that's the thinking. That's completely personal preference, but I think if you're resorting to like stop doing this don't do this ever again until you  Just you know you can do better than that and finally You know the most important or at least tied for most important with intrigue your hook needs energy Right like you're trying to invite an audience in You're trying to close the gap between the camera and you and their phone and them, right?

And why this is important in Hooks is because that's people's introduction to you. Um, the first things you say is, is their, is their introduction to you. Um, and a lot of people sounds like they're reading a script when they're reading a script. And I, I knew you'd probably use a script or something like that.

Um, but that's not really an excuse to sound like it. So I'll read my script verbatim and you'll notice the difference in how natural it is. Um, because I tend to, I go off the script all the time because it's easier to stay natural. But let, let's, I'll just read a sentence. There's something important to note here.

I've always seen every mediocre creator fail to understand this. Uh, when their video's doing bad. You see how it's different, you see how it's worse. And this is also the thing, uh, none of the social creators really talk about much because it's hard to sell this to people as like the actual reason you're not getting views and the actual reason your hooks aren't working.

It's, it's the energy of the video. You'll get mediocre creators, right? Like, the sort of creator that went viral because they, they went on the, they got on the platform early, or they just got lucky with a, you know, viral video that worked once. They get a few hundred thousand followers, uh, and then their, like, views start to drop off because people realise they weren't that interested, and they didn't actually know what they were doing to begin with.

And they, they don't want to admit they know fuck all about making good videos, so they're gonna blame attention spans. And, uh, you know, like, kids these days. And they'll look at videos that do do well, and they'll, like, turn to things like Mr. Beast, and things that are heavily sensationalized, and, you know, they'll start thinking, Oh, loud is good.

I, I see this so much. Creators that start floundering, start failing, and they start doing, like, Today we're gonna be Like, that's, that's not, it's not natural.  Energy does not equal, you know,  loudness, you know, don't shout at your audience. Um, but that's, that's harder to understand because anyone can shout and think they're being energetic.

Uh, talking to your audience is, is, um, is practice and it's a bit of showmanship, but it's mostly understanding, um, how you talk normally to your friends. Um, because I, I assume you have friends and I assume they find you interesting. And talking like that to camera. Like, I've managed to, and it took me a while, but I've managed to kind of get into a groove where the camera I can think to myself, is like, is like a human being that I'm talking to.

Uh, you know, a very quiet one that doesn't seem to talk back, but, you know, a person nonetheless. So when I say you need energy, and, uh, trust me, this is, this is so big. I don't mean you need to be hyperactive. I mean, you need to be talking, um, like you do naturally, right? And on social media, um, you need to be, you know, uh, I'd say the tone you need to have is like you, like, times 1.

3. No, it's, it's, or it's you, here's, here's what the tone you need to have is. It's you, when you're with your friends, and you suddenly remember you've got like an exciting story to tell. You know, that moment where you're like, Oh, did I, uh, did I mention a thing that, um, was this? Yeah, no, no, it ended up, it ended up happening, and look, the, the crazy thing is, and this is nuts, that's, that's what it is, it is, it should be naturally you, but with, uh, when you're, when you're a little bit excited, and that's, that's good energy.

Like, when do you ever shout? When you're drunk? When you're angry at your son? Like, what, what, you know? I think that's a huge, um, misunderstanding. But anyway, those are the four main things of a hook. And you're probably like, but I, I thought these, you know, hook list works, and there are good turns of phrases that make up a good hook, but there are only good turns of phrases when they seem to be coming natural.

You know? If you say, did this guy just, that's why energy is so important,  Your tone of voice. Because ultimately any hook can sound good when the person delivering it sounds interested in what they have to say. Whereas, you can have the best hook ever, that's got 2 million views in someone else's video, repeat it word for word, but if it sounds like you're not interested, then why should the audience be?

So, that's why templates. You'll never see me touting anything like that. You'll never see me stealing someone's hook. Because it's, it's tacky and it's sensationalist. You know, your hook should just be natural to the script. It should just tell people what to come in the video, and it should be in an exciting, natural, and personal way.

 There's a lot you can say about scripting. Like, a lot. And you can go on and on and, you know, you can bring up these complex ideas like, you know, the hero's journey and like, you know, storytelling techniques used by people who make like art, art, you know, like films and TV shows and, and books and they're just, they're good.

And. You know, if you're a first year film and TV student, they're very good to know. But when it comes to social media, it's pompous to claim that you should really follow the rules of any of those. Um, it's just not the same. We're not making great fiction. Um, social media content is quite literally not processed on the same brain region of fiction.

It's just, you know, saying things like that is just a way for, you know, people who don't know what they're doing to make everything sound really complex and, and just sell you the idea that they're smart and you're not. They're not, don't worry. Most, most gurus who, whose whole thing is, I make viral videos, join the viral video  team, no shade, is a complete bumbling buffoon, generally.

Scripting's very easy, and there's, there's not a lot to say on it, because it's not that complex, and you don't want to spend lots of time on it, because you don't have lots of time. So, you won't script every single video, you will do stuff that's reaction kind of content. And, um, not every single video you'll read your script to the word, right?

So, this chapter on scripting is, is just gonna, is gonna be fairly short. We're gonna get through it very quickly. Cause, uh, you'll see why. Mostly, the day I started writing good hooks was the same day that I started writing good scripts. Because it's the same skill. It's completely the same skill. Writing a script for a short form video, or even, uh, long form, uh, you know, like YouTube content, is effectively just opening and closing curiosity loops.

You know, and doing it very well. You wanna be very good at it, but That's effectively all it is. And, uh, basically this just means your scripts is just a matrix of payoffs and hooks, and payoffs and hooks that at some point ends just before people were about to get bored. So what do I mean by a curiosity loop?

Because that's, there's terminology there, right? Uh, curiosity loop is essentially just, uh, anything that makes people curious. Your first curiosity loop is going to be the, the hook at the start of your video. And then what most. Bad content creators do is go well, I've hooked them good now. I'm gonna answer the question I asked in the hook one and a half minutes into the video.

Their thinking being that once the audience is hooked, they're somehow not able to notice that you're fucking around with their time  for attention, like.  It's stupid because what you end up with is just a video that's just one long curiosity loop That's you know, obviously being dragged out and probably got loads and loads of filler and irrelevant details  that either Your audience doesn't swipe away and they're pissed off or they go I got a good example Uh slash anecdote about this.

Um, I once helped someone um, I gave someone advice on a tiktok, you know, they they came to me and they asked me to and it was I think it was a YouTube shot, but the hook was something to the effect of Logan Paul has just made the biggest mistake ever. And then they immediately went, Logan Paul is a YouTuber who was born in 1996 in a small American town.

And they were asking me why I thought people were dropping off. At the 5 second mark. They were saying that, um, Well, I've clearly got a really strong hook, So what's making people leave? They should be hooked to find out the big mistake. First off, audiences are smart, They know when you're wasting your time.

But, um, Secondly, One hook isn't enough to sustain people for a whole minute. Or, on other platforms, potentially three or more minutes. Here's, here's how to look at it. When you're writing a script, Your, your hook, your first curiosity loop, Should basically be immediately answered, Or immediately.  You know, the question you ask, or the question you make the audience ask, or the intrigue, you want to immediately start solving it.

Because then the audience goes, Fuck, okay, this guy's not wasting time. You know, it honestly does numbers for retention. And then, while delivering that answer for the hook, you then want to, uh, say something that raises eyebrows, you know, or do something that's almost another hook. You go, well, The reason is, is they did this, and then, then, then this.

You know, because, how else was he gonna fix the thing that he had done? You know, people go, oh, what is that? That's, they've got a new curiosity loop, and you probably didn't fully solve the one you You, you asked in the hook, so, so now they're, they're twice as curious. You know, you're building up curiosity, but you're still giving them answers.

And then, you know, you go to answering that new thing, and then maybe you say something like, Oh, but, but he had these crimes for X and Y, and not to mention that, we'll have to get to that in a minute. And then, you know, people go, Oh fuck, I want to know about that, but also this. You know, and you create this, you know, this matrix of, you know, things people are curious about, and then things they want to hear, and things you've teased.

You know, it's, it, you create a web. Your script should be creating a web. There's a, there's a really good scene from, um, the TV show Malcolm in the Middle that, uh, illustrates, um, Sort of what you want your viewer to be going through, uh, when they watch your video. 

So yeah, essentially like that, but making sure at the end of the video, the viewer actually has all those questions answered. There's a, there's a phrase I hear a lot of creators say that kind of does this, where they'll go. But to understand that, first we need to know about X. Or, uh, we'll get to that right after we deal with Y.

Um, X and Y in those examples being like, you know, an intriguing statement or hook. Like, another hook, basically. This also needs to feel natural as well. It needs to, as I said before, it needs to roll off the tongue. It needs to feel like this is actually how You know the conversation is going sort of like you're actually you're actively trying to get to the point Um, but you keep remembering.

Oh, there's that and we have to cover this and we have to offer you to understand that We should you know Like like what happens when you tell a complex story to someone you haven't seen in a while But like every new loop you bring up needs to relate to your initial hook But it all needs to you know, people need to understand where you're going The, the detour comes back that you're still on track.

There's a creator that does this really, really well. Um, his name is Christopher Claflin. Um, I think he's an expert, uh, TikTok. Um, I think, I think his strong suit is his scripts. I want to go through a video because there's one that. So perfectly describes what I'm talking about. The viral formula behind the Bentley girl is more science than art.

And I'm here to explain it to you the exact formula for why these videos worked so well and how you can do the same thing in your business and why jet car as a brand could be ruined by these videos. But first, let's talk about why these videos work so well. Starting with the obvious, a confusingly beautiful woman.

There's definitely a shmexy appeal here, but it's done in a classy way. Like, you don't watch these videos thinking like, Oh my gosh, I hope nobody knows that I watch these videos. But rather, what did I just watch? Like, what am I feeling right now? Do I maybe need a Bentley now? You might not be sure of what you feel, but you definitely feel something.

And what you feel is part of why this girl might ruin the jet car brand in the future, but that is for later in this I think his videos can be a bit long. Um, I'm not saying you should write videos exactly like that. But you can see how he's very subtly taking you from, uh, you know, the opening question, setting the scene, then saying, this is how it's going to be the worst thing Jet Car has ever done.

And then he starts saying, he's like, but what is exclusivity? And then, and then he'll start explaining that. And then he'll say something like, but it's the, it's the exact reason that we think that it's wrong, that it might be right or, you know, vice versa. And he could.  Uh, just write a script that says all those things.

Well, this is what's happening, it's because of these three main reasons. Um, this, this, and this. Um, and the reason that it's bad is because of this. But that's not, um,  that doesn't keep opening curiosity loops. As I said, personally, I think he is a little bit slow paced with how he writes. I've never loved his videos in a personal way, but they do very well, and I think they're worth watching. 

The easiest way I've found to do this, um, when I'm looking at my scripts is, um, I'll have my script and I'll make sure it's nice and spaced out and I'll go line by line to make sure that, uh, every other line there's either a question that's intriguing or a, or an intriguing statement that's like, but that's exactly why it's a good thing, you know?

And then every other line should be another hook, another intriguing thing. And then. The, the text that follows it should be answering the, uh, curiosity loop you've just opened. Basically, a lot of my, a lot of my scripts will be to the sort of rhythm of Open loop, explain, open loop, explain, open loop.  Close loop.

Close loop. Close loop. Satisfy hook. You know? I do a lot of top 5 videos at the moment. You're probably aware of those. Um, I do them because they work right now. When you hit a content format that works for you, uh, run it into the ground. Honestly. Of course. Do what works best. Don't have artistic integrity on social media.

For those videos, the formula is more like Open hook, you know, these are the top five thing people want to know about. And then you open the loop for number five, and then you close the loop for number five. And then you open the loop for number four, close the loop for number four. All the way to the end.

Um, what I've noticed about this is, um, so technically when you get to number one of a list, um, you satisfy the hook from the beginning, if that makes sense. So you need to make sure that when you re hook, when you go, Number one, this thing that did this. It's really intriguing because you want people to still watch to the end of the video even though they now know all five things You're going to talk about.

You generally should try and script a video with rising intensity Meaning that the last thing in your video should be the most exciting, the most shocking, the most intriguing, the most, you know, the most Emotional, you know, because at the end of the video, what do audiences do? They decide whether they're going to share the favorite Uh, like, maybe follow.

Like, that's when they, the majority of your audience is making decisions about how they engage with the video. But, I would say you want the second most shocking, intriguing, emotional thing at the start of your video.  So when I do this in top fives, it'll be, number five will essentially be number two, maybe number three.

You know, it'll be the second most interesting thing because it acts as a hook. The two times you want to influence, uh, viewer behavior the most is at the start and at the end of the video. At the start of the video to get them to continue watching, at the end of the video to Share or comment or follow.

So really this is when you want people to have the the best taste in their mouth If that makes sense. Finally, I just want to talk about like where to put your call to actions Um, I always put a call to action in a video because at the end of the day You're making content to make your viewers essentially do something even if it's just follow you or keep watching your content You want your viewers to do something? 

And you may as well max out all your engagement metrics on a video. So always do a call to action. I always sandwich it right before the most intriguing part of the video, right before the hook is satisfied. Um, when feels most natural for you to mention. But, um, I never call to action at the end of a video.

The only time I put a call to action right at the end of a video, like it's the last thing in the video is when it's, It's asking the viewer to commit a behavior that you need to do off the video such as Go to my page or go to this website or go to you know Go to this other thing because you don't do that halfway through the video that'll affect your views and they'll forget by the end of the video if the call to action is like or comment or follow which they can do while still watching the video and You call to action in the middle of the video  That's fine.

They, you know, it won't affect anything negatively. Plus, because they've still got a more intriguing thing to come, they're more likely to do it instead of scroll away. But yeah, a call to action doesn't have to be complex. Uh, even if you just ask for followers, you say. Before I get to the end, please just follow me.

People, well, most of the time people don't follow because they just forgot and, uh, the small influence of you asking them to follow will, will actually make them go and do it. Just one note, uh, generally for, like, all of the scripts, um, you always want to be thinking about what sort of comments people will leave.

A lot of this is gonna be on your topic of the video. People will just comment, like, the, the topic will be the thing that drives the most comments. But if you want to pepper in, like, little mistakes or slip ups or little things that you don't quite answer all the way, Um, then, go for it. It's a great way to get comments and engagement.

Um, all my most viral videos, I've accidentally made a mistake, or on purpose made a mistake. And that's what everyone in the comments talked about, and it's clear it's a big part of what's driving engagement. It won't make a viral video out of nothing, but it does, it does, uh, drive better results.

 I don't hear a lot about this, and I, I think it's very important to talk about the actual image, or the frame. Because short form video is, is, well, literally that, it's video. It is a visual medium first and foremost. If it was only just about the talking, uh, People can go to podcasts, they can go, they can go so many other places just for talking, right?

People are on these platforms to look at their phone. So you should be thinking about what you're giving them to look at as another means to, um, to maximize your, your engagement, your, your attention. Like, you should still spend all your time on hooks and the script. But arguably, how the video looks is gonna be actually more important.

In sales, if you've worked in sales, you're probably familiar with the 55 38 7 rule, which is a rule of communication, That basically says 55 percent of how much people like you is determined by non verbal communication. Um, so that's like your facial expressions and your, your body language. Uh, 38 percent is your vocal communication, so that's like your tone of voice and like the, the energy of your voice.

And then only 7 percent of your message is um, is what you say, it's the actual words. Those are pretty big proportions, and even if it's not 100 percent those proportions, that's still substantial enough to think about how are we coming across visually. When people are watching our short form content, they're, they're watching it as much as, if not more, than they're listening.

And people are on their phone, on social media, usually because they just want something to stare at. So because of this, it's very important that That we use the visual elements, right? We should make sure that we're not just optimizing our script when half of the entire video is how it looks. We could be doing so much more.

And conversely to that, if you've got bad framing, then you should be doing stuff less. You should be taking things out of the image, you know? Basically, just like with cinema, everything that's going on in the frame of your video is extremely important. And there's lots of things to like, think about and to implement.

That is gonna directly affect how viral you go. Those things are gonna be, you know, text hooks, visual hooks, uh, visual disruptions, visual pacifiers, and, and body language. Which we're gonna go over all those things, uh, from now. Real quick, I've just got some notes on framing in general. First and foremost, just like with hook writing, it is about clarity and simplicity.

A general rule with short form is if you look at your video, you know, close one eye and unfocus your vision and don't understand what's going on, then someone that's watching drunk or half asleep or like on an iPhone 4 isn't going to either. And similar to in the hook section, you really don't have very long  to get a viewer to understand what's going on in the video.

Um, so when posting a video, when making a video,  The first thing to look at is going to be the very first frame. Is it clear what's happening from your first frame? Is there a clear subject? Is there a clear, um, uh, object? Is there something that connotes what the video is going to be about or where the eye should look at?

People are impatient and they need to know immediately what's going on. What they're in store for, just, just by looking at your TikTok. Uh, a good example is like reaction or like stitch content, uh, which does this well. Because usually a reaction or a stitch content is just another clip of someone else speaking to begin with, right?

It's actually the visual of that sort of content that lets us know that it's gonna be a react. Um, you'll, you know, either it will say Stitch incoming on the screen, or you know, the reaction content will be in a corner, so the audience knows that uh, once that person's done speaking someone else is likely to come in and refute, and that's all communicated visually.

You have a person looking down at their phone or, or a screen, which is in the same direction of a superimposed video,  we know that that person is watching them. Uh, maybe we have a caption in the corner and a text box somewhere that explains immediately what the discussion is about and what you're gonna get out of this video.

It's clear from the first frame. Or look at this sort of weird stuff that gets like the hundreds of millions of views. There's these videos where like they're in India and it's like game content and it'll have like 150 million views always. Um, and it's because if you look at the framing, I'll put a thing up, you've got like um, You've got a very obvious game, you know that that ball goes down that thing and lands in that thing.

You've got bright colors indicating each thing, and through the framing, because we see the long thing or the hidden objects, we know that those kids are attempting to get that thing in there and when that thing gets in there, something happens. And that's all visual. That's all visual. It's so powerful.

Another way to think about communicating what your video is about from the the the visual of the video. Is, um, a green screen, and, and that's something you can do on any of the apps. Um, it's very easy to do. But, uh, essentially, you just put behind you, uh, a thumbnail. You know, you, you start off a green screen video, and you just put behind you the thing you're talking about.

This is, is a great way to say from the first frame, someone is talking about this thing. People don't even need to hear your hook to know what the video's about. Now, someone who does this really well is, uh, Jason Pargan. I think that's how you say it. Um, check his videos out for good green screen videos.

And it's great because if your idea is, like, very hard to get across in your hook, if it's a more complex thing, you can really use the fact that you're showing a video. to, to illustrate what you're talking about. There's a few general rules on image framing when it comes to social content. Uh, one is, is simple, uh, very easy to understand.

You want basically just your subjects and a lot of contrast to take them out of the background. Um, and then everything else, get it out of frame because it's just distracting, especially with noise.  Mess or just like if something else is going on in the image, it draws the eye away from what's happening.

Um, a lot of text is also very bad. You also want to make sure the most important details is to the center of the screen and just above. That's roughly where the, the viewer's eye. is resting when they come onto a video, and that's where the viewer's eye is most likely to feel comfortable resting. And then, if you need to direct viewers to a certain part of the screen, maybe you're now doing something with your hands, or there's an image you want people to look at, um, best thing to do is put it, you know, just above the center, because that's where the viewer's eye is.

But if you can't do that, for whatever reason, Then, you know, use your graphic design brain, use leading lines, you know, in your framing, or gesture, maybe hand gesture towards something, you know, if you've got a face up here, you can either edit a thing. Or hand gesture, a movement here, and that will naturally bring the viewer's eye down.

So that's a good way to change where the viewer is looking to the thing you want them to be looking at. Which is important because if they're not looking at the right thing, they might not understand the video and they might not see your hilarious joke you put.  You should also use safe zones, I've included some with the course.

Um, that's just so you can avoid putting like, important details where the engagement buttons or the caption is going to be. But generally, if you keep the important details centre and just above, that's always going to be away from people. Any, any UI elements, but the first feature you can make use of with the visual your image to get people to watch more is text hooks  You'll see this all the time But the the text hook is it takes advantage of the fact that most people read quicker than they can talk So people can read a sentence before you can say it.

So if you're still saying your hook But you've got a text hook on screen, people can read that first, so they can even more quickly know what the video's about and decide whether or not they want to watch. I'd say there are just a few rules with the text you put on screen. The first rule with making a text hook is to use really simple words.

Uh, I always say, think about road signs. You know, You know how you can read road signs like, you know, that, you know, the second you see them, you know exactly what they're saying. You want to use those kind of words because people only have split seconds to read what you're saying, let alone then comprehend what the words mean.

And usually in a video, you're also talking at the same time. Also, to get more bang for your buck, your text hook shouldn't be exactly the same as the thing you say. So you might say something about a thing that's happened, but your text hook might be like, aliens confirmed? You know, they're related to the same story, but they're basically just two halves of the same hook, but they also work as separate hooks, if that makes sense.

So they should be different, but connected, But also total one hook. The reason for this is, uh, if you just say the same thing that you said in the spoken hook, then you're just, you're wasting space. You may as well not do one or the other. Some, sometimes I, I say, uh, when, when a video has a, a, a text hook, um, and a verbal hook that's exactly the same.

Um, I say just cut out that bit where you say the, the, the original hook, because you may as well just get right into the video if they're gonna be the same anyway. But also, just keep the text high contrast, it's very easy to read, and like, big and bold. Um, so, just so it's, it's very easy, you, you just want it to be very, very easy to read.

So that's, that's a decision about colouring of the text, but also  Uh, that's also something to look at when you choose a font. Choose a font that's very, just, clear, and obvious, and doesn't look cheap. The, the, the presets in the apps generally are fine. I mean, some of them have very tacky presets, but, um, they're all good.

The next thing I want to talk about is visual hooks. Uh, visual hook is basically just something on the screen that implies that later in the video there will be a payoff. So, a good example is a board with pieces of information missing. Um, maybe some unfinished construction work or a basketball net with basketballs being thrown at it, but not quite in just yet.

It's a way of, without words, saying if you stick around, you're gonna see this thing do the thing you want it to, you know, that, get that satisfaction. I spoke about, like, reaction clips and, you know, reacts. before. But this is similar. The, the, the visual of having a person there and a person there, and you know one's going to respond to the other, implies to the audience that there's going to be a payoff.

They just have to, you know, stick around for it. Lists and compilations do this. Some people do it in app with like a blank side of the screen thing. I do it with the little timers in the corner. It's just a way to visually imply that there's something else coming and you should stick around without saying it.

Cooking videos do this because you see the ingredients and the is going to be how it turns into food. Uh, the rug cleaning videos do this because you go, How does that black mess turn into a nice rug? Art videos do it because they show a piece of art growing one thing at a time from draft to final concept.

And they're just waiting to see that, you know, beautiful final image. Visual hooks are more powerful than spoken hooks, um, but they're much harder to do. But you gotta think, someone telling you, This will happen by the end of the video, Okay. Versus you just knowing, intuiting that it will happen by looking at the video is way more powerful because it's, it, that's voiceless.

If a viewer comes to that conclusion because of a visual hook, then they're not gonna think anyone told them to keep watching because it came from within their own head. This is something you can get creative with and there's, there's obviously a lot of different ways to cut it. One, one commonly applicable version of it is like your before and after. 

Posts, you know, like barbers do this They show someone who's really clapped and then you know They'd long out the before they show him snipping the hair and then the after and they look beautiful But is the audience, you know, you're gonna get that it's implied But it's this goes beyond the hook as well Like just constantly having something in your video that implies the next thing is coming is just great  compilations do this  You know, people see it's just ticking one over, one over, one over, and that makes people know they're going to get a new hit soon, just because they get into that rhythm.

Uh, green screens do it, do, because you can show a thing behind you, talk, and then show another thing, and same thing, it's like a, a bit of a dopamine loop. You just wanna be taking into account everything the viewer can see. Like, like, for example, um, the caption of your video is usually displayed just under the screen.

Um, I've noticed, and I've asked to several other people, um, that when a video starts to get boring, people usually go and read the caption, and Sometimes, you read something in the caption that makes you go, Oh, I will stick this video out. You know, that's something that's on screen and can influence viewer behavior.

Don't have your caption be like, if the hook's like, These are the ten ways to do this, and you caption the video, These are the ten ways The hook might be like, These are the ten ways to do this, but then the caption would be like, I cried during number seven, Or like, something that's like, Baby plum tomatoes can do what?

You know, something that's just like, Oh, I want that to come up, that sounds interesting. It's there, you know, use it, use everything. The goal of a visual hook is just to implicitly communicate to your audience. Stick around, and you will see this happen. This is crucial for engaging viewers, and honestly, it makes it much more likely that they're gonna watch your video to completion.

Next you have what I call a visual disruption. Um, it's kind of like a visual hook, but it's more shocking, and oftentimes it's actually video's content. Some people call it a pattern interrupt, but I don't think that, it doesn't really make any sense. A visual disruption, in essence, is showing something weird or shocking or intriguing as the first thing in your video with the goal that people are gonna stop scrolling out of shock.

They're gonna go, whoa, what's that? What's going on here? It's different from a visual hook because it doesn't necessarily set up a payoff or really have any meaning at all.  Other than being a shock to the system and being so different from what people are scrolling through that they go, Whoa, ideally it's related to your video.

Sure, but it doesn't have to be, just has to grab people. Some people relate it to their video where they'll grab the emotional high point from later in the video and tease it at the start.  Uh, Louis Saunderson does this hilariously well. Uh, I've seen other videos where it's like a exaggerated dramatization of a common pain point in their like target demographic.

So, you know, it'd be someone uh, you know, stubbing their toe, but you know, you know, there'll be so much blood that they're just pouring ketchup all over their foot. And it's a, it's a bit of a gruesome image, but it's, uh, It can, it can quite literally be anything though. As long as it's disruptive and weird, it will work.

Just try not to be overly clickbaity, because you will end up with bad faith from your audience if you do this. Another thing to think about using is a visual pacifier. Uh, a visual pacifier is effectively just giving the audience something else to watch alongside your video. And when you do it right, it's very, it's really effective.

The most obvious example of this is slime content. Um, Slime content is the most extreme version of a visual pacifier, same with like Subway Surfer Clips or Minecraft Parkour. You've got the thing, but maybe it's a very talky video, and then you've also got this really engaging video of slime or industrial presses that people can watch while they listen to what the person is saying on the other side.

Um, but this isn't very classy, is the problem with this. But I've seen some creators go through this Scripts while they, um, do something with their hands, so they'll be constructing something, or they'll like, you know, wrap a present, or maybe they're out for a walk, or they're like, cleaning a surface, so you see that, you know, progress.

A lot of female creators, uh, will be putting on makeup as they talk, so they're getting progressively more, you know, made up. You know, all these things are ways to like, work it into the diegesis of your video. Choose this carefully, it might not work for your brand, or your content, it doesn't always work for everyone.

It's um, you know, not all things that you can talk about, uh, have a natural visual element like, like the things I just listed. But the, the, the simple idea behind a visual pacifier is just giving yourself, uh, giving your audience something to, uh, look at that changes over time. So, uh, I usually do this in my videos by, um, We're in the editing.

When I edit my videos, which are very talk y, I, I try to make sure to have at least two things on screen at once for the majority of the video. Not all, to, you know, give it breaks, but for the majority. Um, and I'll do this through a split screen because I think that's the most, uh, natural to an audience.

Um, it's not too distracting. I'll go through my video, I'll have an image that corresponds to what I'm saying, and then put it up for a certain amount of time. And just about. the point when the audience deciphers what's going on in the image and they understand it, a new image comes along, right? Or maybe I'll cut to myself, uh, for emphasis.

But something will change. Uh, a good, a good rule of thumb, in general, is the, uh, 5 second rule. When you're editing and it's been more than 5 seconds since anything changed visually, Uh, you might lose your audience. Uh, some people say 2 seconds, some people say 3 seconds. I think 5 seconds is about the max where nothing changing visually actually starts to get boring.

You gotta be careful. The more stimulation you give your audience is not always the better. It is not a linear up down.  Curve, you know, at some point you keep adding things to the screen. You start to confuse your audience So a lot earlier in my career, I would over edit every single thing on screen But not only did that take way longer to make it also took confused viewers and came across as less sincere.

So when you're adding elements and you're changing elements, make sure to take into account where the viewer's eye line is. If you're adding an image, but there are eye lines on the face, add the image out of the eye line. Whereas if you want them to look at the image, put it in the eye line, swap yourself.

Just think about where The viewer's eyes when you add elements to keep, keep the video more interesting. This is not something that's going to solve a bad video, but it's just being courteous to your audience and giving them something to look at. And the last and once again most important thing of um, your image and your framing and your visuals.

Uh, is gonna be your body language and like your facial performance in general. Just like any situation in real life, you need to have warm, inviting body language to make people want to spend the next couple of their minutes of time with you. Um, this isn't just your own body language though, this is also how far the camera is away from you.

If your camera is really close or you're, you're really zoomed in, that can feel uncomfortable. Um, and then really far away would feel a little bit cold. You want to get the right camera distance away from your audience. You know, just like with a real person, if you were too close or too far away, it'd be a bit weird.

It'd be a bit uncomfortable. Um, this is dependent on the format. If you're filming with a professional camera, it makes sense it's far away. That's more like a friend conversation. If you're taking a selfie video, then it's fine to be up close because that's more like you're talking with a friend on FaceTime.

Another thing on that note, a big, uh, Big mistake that a lot of creators make is eye contact. They just they make way too much Basically, you want to be looking into the lens of your camera right in the lens sort of the like you would a person's eyes You know When you talk to people you don't stare at them the entire time you look away to think and you come back and you look Away, and you come back, you know, I don't know what the exact specifics are on it, but You don't stare down the barrel the entire time.

This is my issue with like relying on teleprompters is because you can't look away because you don't know what you're saying if you look away and it creates this really unnatural staring. In sum, a visual hook is more important than whatever you're saying. Um, you want to give the viewer a nice clear image with a warm, friendly atmosphere and a face they could imagine actually talking to in real life.

Um, maybe over FaceTime or over drinks or hanging out. Um, But it needs to feel real. Also, it just makes you look more trustworthy because you feel more real and your image makes sense. It's not messy. It's not confusing. Um, and just makes you more established overall. Honestly, just next time you make a video, think about what's on the screen.

 I don't hear a lot about this, and I, I think it's very important to talk about the actual image, or the frame. Because short form video is, is, well, literally that, it's video. It is a visual medium first and foremost. If it was only just about the talking, uh, People can go to podcasts, they can go, they can go so many other places just for talking, right?

People are on these platforms to look at their phone. So you should be thinking about what you're giving them to look at as another means to, um, to maximize your, your engagement, your, your attention. Like, you should still spend all your time on hooks and the script. But arguably, how the video looks is gonna be actually more important.

In sales, if you've worked in sales, you're probably familiar with the 55 38 7 rule, which is a rule of communication, That basically says 55 percent of how much people like you is determined by non verbal communication. Um, so that's like your facial expressions and your, your body language. Uh, 38 percent is your vocal communication, so that's like your tone of voice and like the, the energy of your voice.

And then only 7 percent of your message is um, is what you say, it's the actual words. Those are pretty big proportions, and even if it's not 100 percent those proportions, that's still substantial enough to think about how are we coming across visually. When people are watching our short form content, they're, they're watching it as much as, if not more, than they're listening.

And people are on their phone, on social media, usually because they just want something to stare at. So because of this, it's very important that That we use the visual elements, right? We should make sure that we're not just optimizing our script when half of the entire video is how it looks. We could be doing so much more.

And conversely to that, if you've got bad framing, then you should be doing stuff less. You should be taking things out of the image, you know? Basically, just like with cinema, everything that's going on in the frame of your video is extremely important. And there's lots of things to like, think about and to implement.

That is gonna directly affect how viral you go. Those things are gonna be, you know, text hooks, visual hooks, uh, visual disruptions, visual pacifiers, and, and body language. Which we're gonna go over all those things, uh, from now. Real quick, I've just got some notes on framing in general. First and foremost, just like with hook writing, it is about clarity and simplicity.

A general rule with short form is if you look at your video, you know, close one eye and unfocus your vision and don't understand what's going on, then someone that's watching drunk or half asleep or like on an iPhone 4 isn't going to either. And similar to in the hook section, you really don't have very long  to get a viewer to understand what's going on in the video.

Um, so when posting a video, when making a video,  The first thing to look at is going to be the very first frame. Is it clear what's happening from your first frame? Is there a clear subject? Is there a clear, um, uh, object? Is there something that connotes what the video is going to be about or where the eye should look at?

People are impatient and they need to know immediately what's going on. What they're in store for, just, just by looking at your TikTok. Uh, a good example is like reaction or like stitch content, uh, which does this well. Because usually a reaction or a stitch content is just another clip of someone else speaking to begin with, right?

It's actually the visual of that sort of content that lets us know that it's gonna be a react. Um, you'll, you know, either it will say Stitch incoming on the screen, or you know, the reaction content will be in a corner, so the audience knows that uh, once that person's done speaking someone else is likely to come in and refute, and that's all communicated visually.

You have a person looking down at their phone or, or a screen, which is in the same direction of a superimposed video,  we know that that person is watching them. Uh, maybe we have a caption in the corner and a text box somewhere that explains immediately what the discussion is about and what you're gonna get out of this video.

It's clear from the first frame. Or look at this sort of weird stuff that gets like the hundreds of millions of views. There's these videos where like they're in India and it's like game content and it'll have like 150 million views always. Um, and it's because if you look at the framing, I'll put a thing up, you've got like um, You've got a very obvious game, you know that that ball goes down that thing and lands in that thing.

You've got bright colors indicating each thing, and through the framing, because we see the long thing or the hidden objects, we know that those kids are attempting to get that thing in there and when that thing gets in there, something happens. And that's all visual. That's all visual. It's so powerful.

Another way to think about communicating what your video is about from the the the visual of the video. Is, um, a green screen, and, and that's something you can do on any of the apps. Um, it's very easy to do. But, uh, essentially, you just put behind you, uh, a thumbnail. You know, you, you start off a green screen video, and you just put behind you the thing you're talking about.

This is, is a great way to say from the first frame, someone is talking about this thing. People don't even need to hear your hook to know what the video's about. Now, someone who does this really well is, uh, Jason Pargan. I think that's how you say it. Um, check his videos out for good green screen videos.

And it's great because if your idea is, like, very hard to get across in your hook, if it's a more complex thing, you can really use the fact that you're showing a video. to, to illustrate what you're talking about. There's a few general rules on image framing when it comes to social content. Uh, one is, is simple, uh, very easy to understand.

You want basically just your subjects and a lot of contrast to take them out of the background. Um, and then everything else, get it out of frame because it's just distracting, especially with noise.  Mess or just like if something else is going on in the image, it draws the eye away from what's happening.

Um, a lot of text is also very bad. You also want to make sure the most important details is to the center of the screen and just above. That's roughly where the, the viewer's eye. is resting when they come onto a video, and that's where the viewer's eye is most likely to feel comfortable resting. And then, if you need to direct viewers to a certain part of the screen, maybe you're now doing something with your hands, or there's an image you want people to look at, um, best thing to do is put it, you know, just above the center, because that's where the viewer's eye is.

But if you can't do that, for whatever reason, Then, you know, use your graphic design brain, use leading lines, you know, in your framing, or gesture, maybe hand gesture towards something, you know, if you've got a face up here, you can either edit a thing. Or hand gesture, a movement here, and that will naturally bring the viewer's eye down.

So that's a good way to change where the viewer is looking to the thing you want them to be looking at. Which is important because if they're not looking at the right thing, they might not understand the video and they might not see your hilarious joke you put.  You should also use safe zones, I've included some with the course.

Um, that's just so you can avoid putting like, important details where the engagement buttons or the caption is going to be. But generally, if you keep the important details centre and just above, that's always going to be away from people. Any, any UI elements, but the first feature you can make use of with the visual your image to get people to watch more is text hooks  You'll see this all the time But the the text hook is it takes advantage of the fact that most people read quicker than they can talk So people can read a sentence before you can say it.

So if you're still saying your hook But you've got a text hook on screen, people can read that first, so they can even more quickly know what the video's about and decide whether or not they want to watch. I'd say there are just a few rules with the text you put on screen. The first rule with making a text hook is to use really simple words.

Uh, I always say, think about road signs. You know, You know how you can read road signs like, you know, that, you know, the second you see them, you know exactly what they're saying. You want to use those kind of words because people only have split seconds to read what you're saying, let alone then comprehend what the words mean.

And usually in a video, you're also talking at the same time. Also, to get more bang for your buck, your text hook shouldn't be exactly the same as the thing you say. So you might say something about a thing that's happened, but your text hook might be like, aliens confirmed? You know, they're related to the same story, but they're basically just two halves of the same hook, but they also work as separate hooks, if that makes sense.

So they should be different, but connected, But also total one hook. The reason for this is, uh, if you just say the same thing that you said in the spoken hook, then you're just, you're wasting space. You may as well not do one or the other. Some, sometimes I, I say, uh, when, when a video has a, a, a text hook, um, and a verbal hook that's exactly the same.

Um, I say just cut out that bit where you say the, the, the original hook, because you may as well just get right into the video if they're gonna be the same anyway. But also, just keep the text high contrast, it's very easy to read, and like, big and bold. Um, so, just so it's, it's very easy, you, you just want it to be very, very easy to read.

So that's, that's a decision about colouring of the text, but also  Uh, that's also something to look at when you choose a font. Choose a font that's very, just, clear, and obvious, and doesn't look cheap. The, the, the presets in the apps generally are fine. I mean, some of them have very tacky presets, but, um, they're all good.

The next thing I want to talk about is visual hooks. Uh, visual hook is basically just something on the screen that implies that later in the video there will be a payoff. So, a good example is a board with pieces of information missing. Um, maybe some unfinished construction work or a basketball net with basketballs being thrown at it, but not quite in just yet.

It's a way of, without words, saying if you stick around, you're gonna see this thing do the thing you want it to, you know, that, get that satisfaction. I spoke about, like, reaction clips and, you know, reacts. before. But this is similar. The, the, the visual of having a person there and a person there, and you know one's going to respond to the other, implies to the audience that there's going to be a payoff.

They just have to, you know, stick around for it. Lists and compilations do this. Some people do it in app with like a blank side of the screen thing. I do it with the little timers in the corner. It's just a way to visually imply that there's something else coming and you should stick around without saying it.

Cooking videos do this because you see the ingredients and the is going to be how it turns into food. Uh, the rug cleaning videos do this because you go, How does that black mess turn into a nice rug? Art videos do it because they show a piece of art growing one thing at a time from draft to final concept.

And they're just waiting to see that, you know, beautiful final image. Visual hooks are more powerful than spoken hooks, um, but they're much harder to do. But you gotta think, someone telling you, This will happen by the end of the video, Okay. Versus you just knowing, intuiting that it will happen by looking at the video is way more powerful because it's, it, that's voiceless.

If a viewer comes to that conclusion because of a visual hook, then they're not gonna think anyone told them to keep watching because it came from within their own head. This is something you can get creative with and there's, there's obviously a lot of different ways to cut it. One, one commonly applicable version of it is like your before and after. 

Posts, you know, like barbers do this They show someone who's really clapped and then you know They'd long out the before they show him snipping the hair and then the after and they look beautiful But is the audience, you know, you're gonna get that it's implied But it's this goes beyond the hook as well Like just constantly having something in your video that implies the next thing is coming is just great  compilations do this  You know, people see it's just ticking one over, one over, one over, and that makes people know they're going to get a new hit soon, just because they get into that rhythm.

Uh, green screens do it, do, because you can show a thing behind you, talk, and then show another thing, and same thing, it's like a, a bit of a dopamine loop. You just wanna be taking into account everything the viewer can see. Like, like, for example, um, the caption of your video is usually displayed just under the screen.

You know, that's something that's on screen and can influence viewer behavior.

Don't have your caption be like, if the hook's like, These are the ten ways to do this, and you caption the video, These are the ten ways The hook might be like, These are the ten ways to do this, but then the caption would be like, I cried during number seven, Or like, something that's like, Baby plum tomatoes can do what?

So, you know, it'd be someone, uh, you know, stubbing their toe but, you know, you know, there'll be so much blood that they're just pouring ketchup all over their foot. And it's a bit of a gruesome image but it's, uh, It can, it can quite literally be anything though. As long as it's disruptive and weird, it will work.

It's not messy. It's not confusing. Um, and just makes you more established overall. Honestly, just next time you make a video, think about what's on the screen.

 Another thing to look at when, um, making your videos, scripting your videos, ideating your videos is the format. Um, formats are something in general you should try and come up with what formats work best for you, but there are, like, everlasting formats, like, every single video is, um, Can be under an umbrella term of another format and I just want to go over in this video The the formats that are basically the most tried and tested and the ones That when you're starting out you kind of want to follow in general If you think and this is assuming you've never made a video before you've got an idea.

That's Super super good or like you're gonna do this in your own original way I was that naive once too, and no you're not. Uh, y you wanna look at the formats before you s start making any other video. Choose a format, look at other videos in that format, and uh, emulate everything you can about them.

That's the only way you're gonna go viral, especially as a beginner. You're very unlikely to come up with the next new, next best thing without playing the game first. I'm very quickly just gonna go over the the main formats, uh, that you and I will be familiar with, and a few notes on how you can Um, how they work and how you can, like, maximize their effect, basically.

So the first one I'm gonna go over is lists. Uh, I do a lot of these. These tend to be, like, top 10s, top 5s, top 7s, that sort of thing. Um, And they'll, they'll usually, uh, ostensibly, uh, rank items from, um, the least something to the most something, right? So it'd be the, the, the, the five most disturbing parasites or something.

With lists, always make the first one to appear. So the, the, the number five or the number ten or the number seven. The first one the viewer sees to be the most, uh, shareable and second most shocking or intriguing. I know you're gonna say, but that's dishonest. They should be numbered in order. Look, we're not, um, we're not, uh, creating an archive.

We're trying to create, uh, content, and content has rules. We need to manipulate people into actually watching because People don't give you the time of day to say, Well, this one's boring, but it will get better. So we need to grab people. If the first item on your list is boring, people will just think naturally that you have a boring list.

Whereas if the first thing on your list is super exciting, people go, Fuck, and it gets better. Even though it may or may not, depending on, you know, what things you're able to find. Having something really shocking up front is, is gonna get people to keep watching. And if it's shareable too, people will share.

Shit, this reminded me of you, you know, immediately. And that's, that's what's worked best for me, and I've done a lot of these. So with lists, the topic of the list is basically your hook. So it's, you need to be creative with the, the categorization of the things you're gonna go through. For example, 10 best films with Jennifer Aniston in them.

It's not really interesting. The reason these are interesting isn't because of the ranking, it's because of the categorization.  Take something that was like, 10 films that were banned for being too racist.  That's, sadly, um, more sensationalist, but more interesting. Because you, you don't really care about the ranking.

You just want to hear ten films that were banned for being racist? Like that, there's ten of them? Next you have compilations, which are similar to lists, but, um, they're different in the sense that they're not ranked in any particular order. Um, and they have no particular amount of sections. Uh, compilations will usually be light hearted, with a series of funny clips, or pieces of media, or like funny comments, or news stories, anything like that.

Um, and they'll be presented by a personality. Uh, think your, your Cody Ko YouTuber types, right? The key to success with compilations is to make the first item, or two, or even three, in the compilation the quickest ones. Not necessarily the best, the quickest. Because by doing that, you set the precedent, you set that motif that every two, three seconds there's going to be a new dopamine hit for an audience that is watching.

And, uh, essentially that is the, the core of a compilation, is it's that dopamine hit, dopamine hit, new clip, new clip, new clip. If you spend ages on the first one, people are going to think, Oh, maybe this is just a video. They might not even know it's a compilation. Or they might think this is a really fucking boring compilation.

Nature of green screens. Uh, green screens are a tool, but it's also a format. Using green screens is a great way to get started because you can do it on your phone very easily. And it's a very visual format, which is great. Uh, if you're talking about anything, a green screen's great because the image behind you backs up your claim.

It makes you look more legitimate. It gives more, uh, gravitas to your words. But also, a green screen, you want to think of sort of like a compilation, which we just discussed. Uh, a green screen, you want to change the image behind you every two or three seconds, especially at the start to, to get the audience knowing that there's going to be a new dopamine here every couple seconds.

A green screen as a format is also, uh, very well and often used as a way to do a compilation. You'll have a series of funny images behind you. When you're making a green screen, it's very important to make sure that the, the words you're saying, you know, the words in your script Uh, correspond to the thing behind you, but also add something separate.

Your script, you know, the script and the images behind you together should be worth more than just the sum of their parts. Um, you shouldn't just be going, This is a thing, and this is another thing. You should be saying another wider point that connects all the images together, but also the images themselves are interesting to look at. 

Uh, next you have reveals and payoffs, super strong, talked about this in the, the, the visual hooks section. This is just any type of content with an implied payoff. Uh, I've seen some people use a whiteboard, some people use emojis or text, and they just convey, they, they just show the audience visually all the things you're gonna cover, and the things, uh, that are covered up or, or aren't on screen show the audience what knowledge gaps they have.

And the, the That makes them want to fill them in. Uh, these can be quick paced, these can, these can be long. I'd say you want to be getting, ripping a thing off the whiteboard. Or, you know, adding a thing to the, the emojis on screen or whatever. Uh, fairly quickly. Um, just because, you know, just for retention's sake, um, but yeah, fairly self explanatory.

A lot of slime content sort of comes under this, think an industrial press video, you know, you want the, uh, you want the press to affect the object and see how it reacts, like, that's a payoff each time, um, but I feel like a lot of you are unlikely to be making slime content. Uh, if you are, power to you.

You know, love that shit. Similar to payoffs, uh, you have before and after content. It is essentially a payoff, but it's Uh, so unique and specific. I think it deserves its own categorization. Uh, before and after I talked before about hairdressers, essentially. Uh, if, if it can work within your niche in any capacity, definitely do it.

You know, it can be, you know, me before work and me after work my, you know, living room before I cook and after there's, there's lots of ways to do this. Um. And compilations of before and after, like mixing those two together, like before, after, before, after, uh, of something that's very visual. I'd rarely see something like that do less than, you know, 10 million views, but only if it works for you and what you want to make videos about.

Next one is comparison. Uh, this one, huge. Always has been on YouTube, now social media, comparison, people love it. And it is simply just getting two items and comparing them and looking at the small differences. The only rule there is, is uh, the two things you're comparing have to be similar in several ways.

There needs to be control elements. So an example would be like comparing McDonald's food in Japan to the U. S. Or comparing the Toyota Aygo  2009 to 2010, you know, the iPhone 15 to 16, uh, you know, the, the, the director's cut of Blade Runner to the, the theatrical cut. All of these things, they're so fascinating because they're essentially the same product, but you want to know the, the, the tiny differences, how do they divulge from each other.

Um, and yeah, that, that, that's a great format. I always see that do well. You just need to express at the start of that video, These things are exactly the same, but they're different. You know, you, you just want to get that across really obviously that they're the same, but there are differences. Uh, next thing is stories.

Uh, this was my creme de la creme for a big part of my career. And there's there's so many ways you can cut a story. Like, there's so many ways that story content works. I would say the most important thing about stories, uh, if you do story videos, is, uh, the perceived reality. You know, that verisimilitude, to use a  The stories you tell on social media have to feel real.

They have to be an anecdote. You have to be like, This just happened to me. Or they need to feel like they were sent in. You know, like you're reading someone else's text messages. Or you're telling the audience about something that happened to a friend. But you can never make up a story on social media, because social media is very paradoxical in the fact that it's supposed to be very, very real.

But it's also simultaneously very, very fake. But it needs to be ostensibly real. It needs to be pretending to be real, at the very least. Right? That's the game we all play. So, a lot of female story time creators, uh, there's one in particular, I can't remember her name, but she applies makeup and she tells a story that is literally just a Reddit story.

Maybe she's changed a few words, but she's pretending, she's speaking in the first person. She's acting like it's about herself. Which is genius, because if you've never seen a video of hers before, you're like, oh my god, that happened to you? No, it didn't, but she's managed to get a story off of Reddit that, you know, has, you know, 10, 000 upvotes.

She knows people will love it. She then pretends it happened to her. It's brilliant. Uh, other, other creators will be a little more subtle with it. They'll read out stories that have come from fans, or they'll, uh, just read out this. They'll be like, this comes from someone on Reddit. Um, or they'll talk about something that happened to a friend of theirs, um, that, you know, is mysteriously unnamed.

With stories, the more outrageous the better, obviously. The more sensationalized it is, it's gonna be great. Um, that's the second main thing. As opposed to authenticity, also,  Sensationalism of the story is important. It is up to you how much, uh, you're willing to be fictitious with it. Um, but generally I'll say to any of my clients, uh, Beef up something that actually happened to you.

And if you're uncomfortable with saying it, say it happened to a friend. Because, because, uh, a story isn't really about the actual truth of the anecdote, you know? When you're telling a story on social media, Whether it happened to you, or a friend, or a fan, or a Reddit user, You have a point you want to get across with it.

You're not just picking it out of the blue. Like, all of the formats are just a way to frame something you want to talk about to an audience in a way that's engaging. So, say you want to talk about,  you know,  toxic masculinity. Uh, a good way to frame it is tell a story about, uh, a friend's ex boyfriend and, you know, he's a toxic man and he, he exhibits all the features of toxic masculinity you want to talk about.

So now, there's an antagonist, it's something that's real, it's a story which humans love, but also you can make your point in there. You know, philosophers of the past always used fables and stories to get their points across. There's no harm in it, there's nothing new on God's earth. Another great, lazy, easy, and very effective one.

Is reacts and stitches i've talked about it several times in this course because it's one of the first things I started doing when I started working with clients to get them views. They are they're just great content They're a good content bucket. And uh, if you're trying to be a like a brand or a person It's great to just have a few.

Yeah, you know Add it into your weekly schedule. They're they're they're very they're very good The reason it's so good, especially if you're trying to be a personality It aligns the audience with you, so say you're reacting to something bad or stupid that you know everyone will disagree with, it puts the audience on your side, which, um, you know, subconsciously is great.

You know, they're like, oh, he was my friend for the duration of that video. That's good, but also it shows you in your natural, you know, as natural as it can be, uh, state. You know, you're, you're speaking reactively. You're like, what an idiot this is, you know, or that's interesting. I actually, I got a story about that.

It's uh, it shows you as natural. It makes people feel like they know you more and that's You shouldn't script a react. Um, the whole point, as I just said, is it's natural. It needs to feel natural. You can have a go at it a few times, like you can pretend you've just seen it for the first time. Like that, everyone does that, if you want to do like a natural react.

But you really shouldn't do that.  In my opinion, um, you might disagree, you might have a specific case in mind where that's appropriate, and that's absolutely fine. Um, but they're supposed to be about like, you as an emotional and personal human being. Another format, uh, that I don't actually see do that well, but I hear about a lot, is Day In My Life.

I've never attempted this, because I know I just, it's not something That I'm able to do well. That's my personal, I know I can't do a day in my life well. Maybe I'll try at some point. But, uh, a lot of people have success with them, although it's not very replicable. You can't, you can do one day in my life, but it's unlikely the next day in your life is gonna work.

That said, um, I, I do, you know, I've watched enough to have a few notes on why they work, why the ones that do work, work. And, um, Basically how to make a successful one. The most successful posts, day in my life, are always funny and snappy and intriguing in some way. They're, they're good. You know, they've got humor, they're almost like a compilation style video where every few seconds there's another joke.

Oh, I did this and then funny thing and then da da da and funny thing. Like, you need, like, joke, joke, joke in there, and, you know, then if you're funny enough, people will watch. The other, the other feature I, I see with day in my life posts that do well, is the day in my life as, because that's the hook, is manipulated to be very intriguing.

So, day in my life as a senior accountant, Not very intriguing, but like, day in my life as a finance bro taking more tests than a  male bovine is like, what the fuck? Like, you gotta utilize the hook space as a hook. You can't just be fully honest, day in my life, this is happening. But yeah, with that said, those are all the viral formats I can think of.

If you think of something else, just get a DM over to me, and I'll add it to the  But, in general, those are all the ones, you know, that's the exhaustive list of all the ones I've ever done or can even think of. You don't have to stick to them, but everything you do should have a feature of it. It should be like, have a compilation y feature, or be a bit like a list, or it should be a bit like a reaction.

Because these It's not just for you to be lazy, it's also because the viewer,  uh, if you have something in a format, it looks like something the viewer's used to seeing, then you have less work to do. on telling the viewer how to understand your video. Um, because they, they know the format. So the format helps them know what's going on.

It, it helps people go, Oh, I like Reacts, I'll watch React. Or, Oh, Lists, I know what that is, I'll watch it. And then you can employ all your other, you know, big brain techniques to keep viewers hooked.
