    "quote": "Think of followers as a 'like' on you as a person, regardless of video.",
    "introText": "Looking beyond basic metrics, follower conversion might seem superficial, but it's a powerful indicator that can significantly boost your content's reach. When someone follows you, they're making a conscious decision to see more of your content â€“ it's the ultimate vote of confidence."
