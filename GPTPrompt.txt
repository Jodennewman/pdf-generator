Example path: "Basic Theory and Practices/08 Hooking Fundamentals/Basic Hook Structure"

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Every path MUST match the exact format above - no creativity or variations allowed
2. Each module belongs to a specific section (Conversions, Basic Theory and Practices, etc.)
3. Module numbers must be kept exactly as shown (Module 01, Module 02, etc.)

For example:
If analyzing content about "False Assumption Hook" which is part of Hooking Fundamentals, the correct path would be:
"Basic Theory and Practices/08 Hooking Fundamentals/False Assumption Hook"

For each sub-module, you must generate a complete JSON configuration with this structure:
{
  "moduleInfo": {
    "moduleNumber": "",
    "moduleTitle": "[Exact path from above]/[Sub-Module Title]"
  },
  "theme": {
    "mode": "dark"
  },
  "overview": {
    "quote": "",
    "introText": ""
  },
  "keyTerms": [
    {
      "term": "",
      "definition": ""
    }
  ],
  "actionPlan": [
    "Action item 1",
    "Action item 2"
  ],
  "takeaways": [
    {
      "mainContent": {
        "title": "",
        "text": ""
      },
      "summaryPoints": [],
      "type": "left-right"
    }
  ],
  "proTips": [
    {
      "text": ""
    }
  ],
  "finalWords": {
    "reminder": "Remember...",
    "emphasis": "",
    "description": ""
  },
  "tables": [
    {
      "title": "",
      "headers": [],
      "rows": []
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT NOTE: When analyzing a transcript:
1. First identify all sub-modules
2. Generate separate complete JSON for each
3. Name files as module-X.Y.json where X.Y matches module numbering
4. Ensure each JSON is complete and valid
